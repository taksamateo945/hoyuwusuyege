Two videos combine to show 30 minutes of gameplay from a pre-alpha build of Battlefront 3, which had been in development from 2006 to 2008.</p><p>These two videos are of an early build of the game, so some textures are missing and sound assets aren't present. The menus show a list of all the maps that apparently had been planned for <i>Battlefront 3</i>, and the videos show what Coruscant and Hoth looked like at the time of this build, for Xbox 360.</p><p>"Some footage of the build of <i>Star Wars Battlefront 3</i> that got canceled,"&nbsp;<a href=#>writes the uploader on YouTube</a>. "This build is from 2007 and was ported over from the PC. ... The game looked very fun to play and runs pretty well other then the obvious frame rate drops. ... This is being run on an Xbox 360 for those of you that got confused."</p><p></p><p><i>Battlefront 3</i> was the third of four games in the series that developer Free Radical had a deal to build for LucasArts. In 2012, Free Radical's cofounder, David Doak,&nbsp;<a href=#>ripped LucasArts' handling</a> of the project, calling his liaisons there "psychopaths who wanted to destroy us."</p><p>LucasArts canceled the game abruptly, saying it had become too expensive to make. Reports since then have suggested Battlefront 3 was nearly complete when it was axed.&nbsp;<span>Previous videos of Battlefront 3 </span><a href=#>have surfaced before</a><span>, only to be swiftly taken down.</span></p><p>Battlefront is&nbsp;<a href=#>due to return</a>, this time built by Battlefield series developer DICE and published by Electronic Arts, which acquired the rights to make Star Wars games after Disney purchased Lucasfilm and its subsidiaries in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2O9sLjYoKanZpOkunB%2Bj2praGlgZH9xe5ZpaGxvaWh8rrvRnmSpqpVirq28x5pkoJmdmr2trdhmpp9lo6mus3nWmqmsZZKWwbW4xJ%2BpqKakYoBuuMSaoqxln6rB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carmina-villaroeli-scandal-and-controversy.html><span>←</span><span>Carmina Villaroeli scandal and controversy: what is the story?</span></a>
