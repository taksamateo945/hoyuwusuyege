But there is more!</p><p>The TMZ report notes that “Sophia’s camp reached out to production and the sides have been talking about the possibility of her joining the show, possibly as a main cast member … and Sophia’s roommate Caitlyn would also make appearances.”</p><p>Both Sophia and Caitlyn know part of the cast, so it would not be a bad idea for them to join ‘RHOBH’ for season 11. However, the insider noted that Caitlyn may not have a spot in the reality show.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFF5KtUg9FW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><p>“Caitlyn advised Sophia to pursue a spot and wants to be a “friend of the show” herself,” noted the magazine. Although nothing has been signed yet, there is hope for the two to snag those empty spots.</p><p>Fans would actually love to see <a href=# title="Kylie Jenner Wears White Mini Dress And Flaunts Fabulous Curves In Thanksgiving Photos At Kris Jenner’s House">Kris Jenner</a> on the Housewives franchise, begging the momager to consider this idea. However, Kris discussed the ending of <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian Opens Up About Her Struggle With Psoriasis – ‘The Pain Was So Unbearable’">KUWTK</a> and when Ellen asked her about joining ‘RHOBH,’ Kris said that she may consider it, but there is a catch:</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“I think I would do it just to go on once in a while and be with my friend Kyle Richards. But as far as me doing a show like that regularly…there’s just too much going on in my life. They do not need a Kris Jenner on that show! They are doing just fine!”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbyjtIycmKKsnK67brbEp6Weql2ovLG0yJpkoa2kmLWqutJmpKKfmKl6q7vIp2StoJVisKK%2F02aYn6yVp3qlsc2iqp5lpJqxpbXSZpueqJGnwba%2BxGZrbWhlboJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gavin-rossdales-new-mystery-gal-revealed-as-actress-and-singer-courtlyn-cannan.html><span>←</span><span>Gavin Rossdale's new mystery gal revealed as actress and singer Courtlyn Cannan</span></a>
