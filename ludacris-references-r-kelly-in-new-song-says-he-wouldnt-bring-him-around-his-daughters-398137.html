During Ludacris’ song, “The Silence of the Lambs,” the rapper introduced a number of modern references that many fans loved hearing, including one about R. Kelly, who’s currently sitting in jail.</p><p>In his song, Ludacris claimed that while he loves R. Kelly, he certainly wouldn’t let the R&B artist around his daughters. Moreover, he later mentioned “Cliff Huxtable,” the character famously portrayed by the formerly legendary Bill Cosby.</p><p>Ludacris came back to the rap game with a number of unreleased tracks. Because of the rapper’s legendary status in the industry, it’s undeniable that he was able to garner features from some of the biggest names in the industry at the moment, including Chance The Rapper.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ludacris new song ft Lil Wayne and it's starts with "I love R.Kelly, but around my daughters I'm uncomfortable" <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/xLRF6mHspK</a></p><p>— MrFab (@heyMrfab) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 16, 2020</a></p><p>Following his Instagram Live session, Ludacris promoted a new initiative called Kid Nation. Obviously, Ludacris, in his song, was referring to two of the most controversial #MeToo cases in the mainstream media.</p><p>R. Kelly, for instance, is currently awaiting trial after he was charged with a plethora of crimes related to sexually abusing young girls and women. Kelly has petitioned to get out of jail a number of times on account of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Bill Cosby, as well, was sentenced, convicted, and then incarcerated for sexually assaulting Andrea Constand sixteen years ago. The comedian has also been pining for an early release, although, both artists’ requests have since been precipitously denied by a court of law.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecqrGir9GiqmaqlZuys7HNnJysZaJiuKa4y7JkoqZdo7K4edKopaBlo5bGtHnHnmSwp6Whsa%2FAjJupoqaXYrWquYyaqaitnpl6qbXSZpuarZedwaa%2B0mZqcnBhaIRw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rules-engagement.html><span>←</span><span>CNN.com - 'Rules of Engagement' is Entertaining, though Not Engaging</span></a>
