<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Julianne Hough Called &amp;quot;Hypocritical&amp;quot; by Mark Ballas For DWTS Critique</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It might be time for a dance off! It looks like <strong><a href=#>Julianne Hough</a></strong> has picked a fight with childhood friend and Dancing With the Stars dance pro <strong>Mark Ballas</strong>. After performing as a dance pro for five seasons — leaving after Season 8 — Hough made an appearance on the popular competition show as a guest judge on Oct. 7, and her comments on Ballas's foxtrot with singer <strong><a href=#>Christina Milian</a></strong> raised some eyebrows.&nbsp;</p><p>"There were moments where I felt like choreography-wise, I felt like it was two people dancing side-by-side rather than together," she said on the show. "So I really want to see [Milian] shine. I've danced with Mark. You have to stand in front to make sure you're seen."</p><p>And though the comments were followed by laughter, the room was tense as Ballas could barely muster a stiff smile.</p><p>Us Weekly caught up with the dancer after the show for his reaction to Hough's harsh critique.&nbsp;</p><p>"The one comment for me that was a little funny is that I make it all about me… all the critiques were at me, and not at [Milian]. So I thought that was a little hypocritical comment," he told Us. "I think [Hough] was very insightful tonight though and gave great tips on lines and how to express. We've had a lot of guest judges and I thought out of all of them she was one of the best. So that part, I love. I was the one who kind of got the heat, but you know what, that's OK! It's fine."</p><p>This isn't the first time there have been <a href=#>rumors of a possible feud</a> between the former childhood friends. Hough and Ballas's relationship goes back to the '90s when Julianne and her brother <strong><a href=#>Derek Hough</a></strong> (currently a DWTS dance pro) moved to London to train with Ballas's famous parents (dance champions Shirley and Corky Ballas).&nbsp;</p><p>Hough and Ballas paired up for the Junior Olympics and both won medals for ballroom dancing. But when Hough claimed she was <a href=#>"mentally and physically abused"</a> while training in London, rumors swirled that she was pointing her finger at the Ballas family.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Safe Haven actress never confirmed those rumors.</p><p>Tell Us: Were Hough's comments out of line?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGupJmWu6%2BxjKGmrp%2BYYrCiuMuem2agqaW8pL7TopqapF2irrO3jJuYpaSRqHqlrc2coKefXay2tbSMrZ%2BeZaOprrO%2FjJypoqyZpsKmv4xrZ2praGZ9</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-carpenter-welcomes-baby-with-fiance-seth-avett-2015108.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Carpenter Welcomes Baby With Fiance Seth Avett</span></a>
