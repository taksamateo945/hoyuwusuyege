On her Instagram account this week, the 38-year-old Broadway star announced she was tested and the results came back positive.</p><p>On her Instagram, the star said she would take to her Instagram Live to talk about the condition and answer any questions that people had for her, including what her symptoms are like and how she’s been taking care of herself.</p><p>Fans of the actress know that she’s one of the most popular Broadway performers. She worked on Legally Blonde and Hairspray, and also appeared on the classic TV series, How I Met Your Mother. Her talents also extend to music with the release of a country music record.</p><p>Page Six claims the Kentucky native has a 10-month-old son named Huck with Thom Hinkle. He works as a television executive. Lauren wouldn’t be the only actress to contract the illness since the pandemic first began and made its way into the United States.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-KdhX9JTJc/</p><p>Before the country went on lockdown, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson took to their Instagram account to explain they too also contracted the coronavirus. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom and his wife revealed they were down in Australia filming a movie.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Due to feeling sick, including typical flu symptoms, they chose to get the test and wound up testing positive.
