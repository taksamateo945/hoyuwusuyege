She was born the 7th of February 1976 in America’s Sunshine State, precisely in the part of Florida known as Clearwater. Being born in the United States makes Marlo a citizen of America, however, her physical appearance is a testament to her Afro-American origin.</p><p>Nothing has been said about her father, but her mum is said to be a woman simply called Emma. Marlo is not an only child, she grew up alongside a sister called Crystal and a brother who was known as Curtis Williams Jr. Sadly, Curtis battled a traumatic brain injury that led to his death at a very young age.</p><p>Throughout her life, Marlo’s mum, Emma, battled an addiction to heroin and it goes without saying that it had a dire effect on her parenting capability. It got even worse when you consider the fact that her husband was not even present to cover up for her shortcomings. When their Emma’s addiction got to an alarming stage, her children had to be taken into foster care and according to Marlo Hampton, she was barely nine at that time.</p><p>After being moved from one foster home to the other, Marlo finally put down roots with the Hopkins family who went ahead to adopt her. The Hopkins were resident in St. Petersburg, Florida, and that was where she completed her growing-up years. Talking about her adoptive parents, Marlo would describe how they took her in when her world was crumbling and offered her unconditional love.</p><p>Marlo’s foster mum was called Arrie and she lived up to 103 years. It was a few days after her 103rd birthday that she passed on.</p><h3><strong>She is a College Graduate</strong></h3><p>Growing up in St. Petersburg Florida, Marlo Hampton achieved her earliest academic qualifications in the vicinity. It’s not known exactly when she enrolled at First Coast High School but she finished from the academic institution sometime in 2005.</p><p>The quest for further academic accolades took her to the University of South Florida to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. Marlo was said to be versed in both social work and interdisciplinary science during her days in college.</p><h2><strong>How Much is Marlo’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>The last estimation of Marlo Hampton’s net worth pegged it at $600k, however, there are a plethora of sources claiming she has a higher fortune.</p><p>Marlo’s bottom line accrued from her annual salary, though the cumulative has never been mentioned in the public space. However, since she started featuring on the set of The Real Housewives of Atlanta television franchise, she has been raking in $100k per season.</p><h3><strong>Sources of Marlo Hampton’s Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Marlo Hampton is one American celebrity that has done a good job of diversifying her sources of income. A few years after she completed her studies at the University, she joined the fashion industry as a designer and a wheeler-dealer.</p><p>Before long, she launched her reality television career which opened another source of generating revenue.</p><p>As her popularity grew, Marlo spread her reach to social media and currently, she is established on the major platforms with a massive number of followers.</p><h3><strong>She Started her Career Journey in the fashion Industry</strong></h3><p>As earlier mentioned, Marlo Hampton’s first port of call was the fashion industry. After she was through with her academic endeavors, she decided to launch a business in the fashion industry by floating a high-end boutique known as Red Carpet Boutique.</p><p>It’s important to note that she left her home state, Florida, after completing her studies and went in search of greener pastures in Atlanta, Georgia, where she cited her fashion boutique. The boutique hit the ground running in 2008 and before long, it acquired a robust clientele base, catering to the fashion needs of the crème de la crème of Atlanta’s elite community.</p><p>Customers who patronize Marlo Hampton’s boutique are offered her own sense of fashion style. Thanks to Marlo’s passion for haute couture, she was able to penetrate the rich and powerful and with her drive and perseverance, she left a lasting impression on them.</p><p>Hampton took her sublime fashion sense to the set of The Real Housewives of Atlanta reality show. She fielded fans in question and answer sessions, teaching them how she came about her flair and knack for style, and it was most beneficial for people who wished to follow suit.</p><p>Throughout her career in the fashion industry, Marlo has done admirably well in educating female folks about fashion tips. We must also acknowledge the Art of Style Tour, which is her multi-city fashion seminar targeted at inspiring female stylists and designers.</p><p>Marlo has made her mark in the fashion industry, serving at the 2016 International Fashion Week as a Style Ambassador. The exact amount that she rakes in from her fashion business has never been disclosed but it is quite huge and contributes a great deal to her bank balance.</p><h3><strong>Marlo Hampton’s Net Worth has Also Accumulated From Reality TV</strong></h3><p>Another viable avenue of generating funds for Marlo Hampton is reality TV and she has appeared in a few. Bravo TV’s production, The Real Housewives of Atlanta (ROHA), marked her debut in reality TV. She joined the show in its fourth season in 2011 as a reoccurring cast, however, as time rolled by, she graduated to a major cast during the show’s 14th season.</p><p>Appearing in RHOA catapulted Marlo to fame and since she joined in 2011, she has recorded 97 episodes and still counting.</p><p>On the show, she was dubbed, a “sassy and self-assured fashion maverick.” While she is currently having a good time as part of the cast of the Bravo reality TV series, Hampton’s debut on the show raised a lot of eyebrows. The reason for this is that she has a long record of arrests in her home state, Florida.</p><p>Some of the charges leveled against her include Disturbed Battery/Great Bodily Harm (she had to set a bond of $5,000 to be set free), parole violation, issuing of bad checks, and possession of firearms. between 1999 and 2003, Marlo went through seven arrests and that was a bad record for someone to take to the set of the Bravo TV show.</p><p>Apart from the Real Housewives of Atlanta reality show, Marlo Hampton has recorded appearances in other shows on television. In 2015, she joined the cast of Exhale and Love and Hip Hop: New York. The year 2019 was when she appeared in a plethora of shows, including The Real Housewives of Atlanta: Porsha’s Having a Baby, Sister Circle Live, Games People Play, How High 2, and Wig Out. Between 2018 and 2022, she was gracing the screen in Watch What Happens: Live.</p><p>When Bravo TV started airing the documentary, ‘I Dream of NeNe: The Wedding, Marlo was part of its cast.</p><p>The Atlanta-based businesswoman woman earned $100kk per season of RHOA but nothing has been said about her earnings from other shows.</p><h3><strong>Marlo Hampton Turned Her House Project into a TV Show</strong></h3><p>Marlo Hampton hinted in 2021 that she had a building project she was constructing “from the ground up.” And in the early part of 2022, she let revealed details of her construction plan.</p><p>When she went to Georgia to meet up with Patrick who was in charge of the building, she took to the May 22 episode of ROAH (an exclusive Bravo Insider preview) to share the details. She requested that Shereé Whitfield and Kenya Moore participate in the conversation; her reason for choosing the duo was that they acquired experience constructing their individual homes. Hampton said she planned to get advice from them and learn from success rather than their mistakes.</p><p>It was through an exclusive Bravo Insider preview of RHOA’s May 22 episode that fans got to know that Marlo’s new home will be equipped with a grand entrance, a lounge area, and a department store-style closet (larger than the bedroom).</p><p>The exact amount that went into the building of the real estate is not known, but it is quite huge. As an investment, Marlo’s house would likely appreciate in value in the future and she stands a chance of making a tidy margin if she should choose to place it on the property market.</p><h3><strong>Marlo also Earns Big on Social Media</strong></h3><p>Marlon Hampton is fast earning recognition on social media platforms. On her Instagram alone, @marlohampton, she has amassed over 1.5 million followers with 4, 544 posts</p><p>After she joined Twitter (@iheartMarlo) on June 2011, Marlo started accumulating flowers very fast and currently, she has over 320.5k followers. Also her followers on her self-titled Facebook page have exceeded 495.1K and still counting. She also operates a blog site through which she sells her merchandise. All these translate to earnings for her.</p><h3><strong>Is Marlo Hampton Married or Dating?</strong></h3><p>Marlo Hampton appears to be single at the moment but she has dated a good number of men in the past, both real and rumored.</p><p>After RHOA star Peter Thomas divorced his wife, Cynthia Bailey, in 2018, fans of the reality show started speculating that he had an eye for Marlo and they were not far from the truth. The duo eventually started dating, but according to Hampton, she was just content having fun with Peter and never took the relationship seriously.</p><p>On the flip side, Peter was obviously taking it seriously; on one of Marlo’s birthdays, he gifted her a new house. However, it has been rumored that the duo have separated but this is yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Earlier in 2011, she dated Charles Grant, a former player of the New Orleans Saints in the National Football League. Their relationship happened during the fourth season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta reality show and they even got as far as getting engaged.</p><p>However, Grant, Marlo and NeNe Leakes got entangled in a complicated love triangle which later blew over, leading to the end of Marlo Hampton’s engagement with Grand and engendering a great friendship between the two ladies.</p><p>It was once speculated that Hampton was going steady with the founder of CNN, Ted Turner. The tale about her romantic entanglement with Ted started after she narrated how she dated a billionaire. According to the reality star, the so-called billionaire first saw her in her boutique in Atlanta and for the ensuing six months, would always come around to feast his eyes, perhaps because he lacked the courage to approach her. This, Marlo said, happened for the ensuing six months until the man gathered the courage to approach her and they started dating.</p><p>Marlo also narrated how she enjoyed their relationship which lasted for five years, during which the man showered her with expensive gifts, including a house. She still lives in the house (called “The Hamptons,”) many years after they split up. To date, the reality star never mentioned the name of her billionaire lover and people naturally concluded it was Ted, but this was never confirmed.</p><p>There was a time Marlo was claimedto be dating rap artist, Jazze Pha but his numerous commitments didn’t give their relationship a fighting chance to survive.</p><p>All her adult life, Marlo Hampton has been rumored to have a string of sugar daddies that have been funding her lavish lifestyle, though most of them remained unknown.</p><h3><strong>What Happened to Marlon Hampton’s Sister?</strong></h3><p>Marlo’s sister, Crystal, has been battling schizophrenia and bipolar disorder which led to her hospitalization in recent times. She is presently getting treatment at an undisclosed mental health facility. While Crystal is in the hospital, Marlo took in her children, Michael and William, and has been playing the role of mother in the boys’ lives.</p><p>When you consider the fact that Marlo has confessed that she loves children and has been battling infertility for years, this arrangement begins to look like a blessing in disguise. The boys are obviously giving her a taste of motherhood while she continues to try to have a child of her own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqivsuoZKGZnaXBsLqMmp6eZZ6awW7DzquroWWRo7FussCmoKWxXaG2p7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keith-hamilton-cobb.html><span>←</span><span>Keith Hamilton Cobb Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
