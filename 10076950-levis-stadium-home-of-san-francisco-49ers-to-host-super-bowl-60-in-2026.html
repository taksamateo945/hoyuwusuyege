Pass-rusher Von Miller was named MVP, and the game was the final one of Peyton Manning's legendary career.</p><p>The Super Bowl is traditionally held in cities with warmer climates, and this will be the <a href=# rel=noopener>14th time</a> the state of California has hosted the event. Only Florida has hosted the Super Bowl more times (17).</p><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams played the Super Bowl in their home stadium in back-to-back years in 2021 and 2022. San Francisco will look to maintain something of a recent trend of NFC teams playing on their home field when they host the event.</p><p>It wouldn't be a shocking development since the 49ers are traditionally one of the strongest teams in the league.</p><p>In addition to their five Lombardi Trophies and seven Super Bowl appearances, they have reached three of the last four NFC Championship Games. The rosters could look completely different by the time the 2026 game arrives, but San Francisco has trended in the right direction of late.</p><p>Perhaps it will both participate in and host the sport's biggest game of the year in 2026.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2uGdnyMpZyvoaNiwLWtw6KspmWYpLqmec6fZKyZnmKzs63NnKCsm59igXqx0axkraddnby0wIysrKmdomKvsMPLZm1pZZmjenN8kW8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./v-wade-historic-court-case-html.html><span>←</span><span>___ v.
