Although Pattinson kept his head down the majority of the time, he smiled for the cameras as the couple made their way inside the theater.</p><p>The Twilight alum has been dating Waterhouse since at least August, when they were first spotted in public near Notting Hill. The couple allegedly parted ways shortly after the August sighting, though they clearly worked things out and are on good terms once again.</p><p>Pattinson dated his Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart for years and was previously engaged to FKA Twigs, who is currently in a relationship with Shia LaBeouf. Waterhouse dated Bradley Cooper and Miles Kane before getting with Pattinson.</p><p>The theater outing, meanwhile, comes days after Pattinson was slammed for his appearance at the most recent Dior fashion show. The actor, who represents Dior Homme, showed up wearing a strange looking brown coat that many fans thought resembled something straight out of Star Wars.</p><p>‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm not very fashion forward but can someone explain to me why Robert Pattinson looks like he‚Äôs starring in&nbsp;Les Mis&nbsp;at this Dior event,‚Äù one fan wrote on social media, while another added, ‚ÄúThey said the Jedi were no more.

A few fans even believed he resembled a medieval monk of some sort.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Of course, not everyone took a shot at the actor‚Äôs appearance. A few fans praised Robert Pattinson for his bold new look and for taking a chance in the hotly contested world of fashion.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipK%2BmvtNmp5qspJ67tLvNZpinnF2owqy1jLCYrZ2inby2v8Rmnqhlk5bAtq3LZp2oql2ZrrWxjKegoKCkYq6nwMSrZJ2hn6d6o63CpKOaq5hif3SDl2luaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10121527-pga-championship-cut-line-2024-tiger-woods-and-projected-list-of-players-removed.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>PGA Championship Cut Line 2024: Tiger Woods and Projected List of Players Removed | News, Scores, Hi</span></a>
