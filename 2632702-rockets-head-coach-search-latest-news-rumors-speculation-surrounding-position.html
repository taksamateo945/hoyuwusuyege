We're a broken team, and we all need to use this break to figure out how we're going to impact change. If we don't want to impact change, then we need to be made aware of that, too, and we'll go in a different direction. We can't continue to go out and play this way. It's easy to see it's a fragmented bunch. You can't win that way.</p><p>Indeed, <span>D'Antoni</span>&nbsp;will not have it easy. The team doesn't appear to have much chemistry; Harden remains allergic to playing defense, and it's questionable if he and <a href=#>Howard</a> have ever jelled.</p><p>Houston is a team loaded with talent.
