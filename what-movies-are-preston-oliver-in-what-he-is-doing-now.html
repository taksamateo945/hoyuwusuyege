His mother,&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Jen Oliver</a>, is a dance teacher, and his&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>older brother</a>,&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Jordan Oliver</a>, is a musician active on Instagram under the handle<a rel=nofollow href=#>_jordan_oliver</a>. According to one of his parents, he became interested in acting in fifth grade when he unexpectedly landed the role of a pirate in the “Peter Pan” school play without telling anyone. He attended Calvary Chapel Christian School in Las Vegas, according to ReviewJournal. Preston began taking drama classes in the sixth grade, attending after-school classes at the talent company Hollywood Access Inc., where he met Coast to Coast Talent Group agents.</p><p>Oliver studied&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>with an on-set tutor</a>&nbsp;while filming “Secrets of Sulphur Springs,” then switched to online school. He will&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>matriculate from high school in 2024</a><u>,</u> however, he took his senior pictures in October 2023. Preston is passionate about basketball and has a&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>trampoline in his yard to practice dunks</a>. He also enjoys playing video games, particularly the battle royale game Fortnite, and the first-person shooter Call of Duty.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Coast to Coast Talent Group&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>took Preston on as a client</a><u>,</u>&nbsp;and helped him make his acting debut aged 12. In January 2019, he played a minor role as Riley Boyd in the NBC television series “Chicago Fire” for two episodes. Starring Taylor Kinney, Christian Stolte, Eamonn Walker, and Joe Minoso, the series follows the reconstructions of daily difficulties that Chicago, Illinois, USA firefighters and paramedics go through at work and in their private lives.</p><p>In April 2019, Oliver appeared in the episode “Her” of the dramatic romantic comedy “This Is Us”, as the son of Kevin Pearson, played by Justin Hartley. Having a talented young teen in a series that follows the lives of middle-aged triplets and their parents and offspring was a welcome change, so Oliver returned for another episode in March 2020. Preston became a&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Screen Actors Guild (SAG) member</a>&nbsp;in the meantime.</p><p>Only a month later, he was cast as Young Michael in one episode of the “Roswell, New Mexico” romantic drama TV series, in which he portrayed the younger version of the lead actor, Michael Vlamis, who played Michael Guerin.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you haven’t watched “This is Us” Season Finale yet you better hurry!

He told ReviewJournal that he always liked paranormal TV series and movies, and had watched the “Ghost Hunters” series with his cousin as a kid. He played the main character, Griffin Campbell, who moves from Chicago to a town near a vacation resort to restore the hotel called The Tremont with his family. Kyliegh Curran and Elle Graham joined him as Harper Dunn and Savannah Dillon, two other prominent characters. Kyleigh&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>told YSB Now</a>&nbsp;that Preston was discussing the “Guardians of the Galaxy” movie when they met at the audition, which sparked their chemistry, as she also loved it.</p><p>Madeleine McGraw and Landon Gordon played Griffin’s younger siblings, twins Zoey and Wyatt, while Kelly Frye and Josh Braaten portrayed his parents, Sarah and Bennett “Ben.” Interestingly, Madeleine and Landon are not twins, as can be inferred from their last names, but Madeleine has a fraternal twin named Aidan.</p><p>The executive producer, Tracey Thomson, told&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Spectrum Local News</a>&nbsp;that “Secrets of Sulphur Springs” was ‘a show for everyone, with the right blend of adventure, mystery, and relatable characters to root for.’ The script adds supernatural events, such as a ghost haunting the hotel and a hidden portal that takes the characters back to the 1930s to explore The Tremont’s origins. Moreover, the second season involves a plot twist; the portal stops working, leaving some characters stuck in the 1960s. Preston described that season in three words: fun, scary, and mysterious. The third season adds romantic elements as Griffin develops a crush on his best friend, Harper, and he can travel to the future. Tracey also revealed that they chose the 1930s as one of the time travel periods, to show how life looked for children and adults under racial segregation rules, according to&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>AwardsRadar</a>.</p><h3><span id=Current_focus>Current focus</span></h3><p>Preston keeps his fans updated on his Instagram account, preston_oliver, on which he has over 100,000 followers. In September 2022, Preston attended the premieres of the “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1” and “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Elemental</a>” movies.&nbsp;A few months before, he took a&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>seven-day trip aboard the Disney Cruiseline</a>&nbsp;ship through the Caribbean region, and&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Jamaica impressed him the most</a>. Preston also went&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>ice fishing</a>, visited&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Hawaii State</a>&nbsp;for a beach vacation, and surfed.</p><p><br>Moreover, he revealed that he&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>bought a guitar</a>&nbsp;in 2022, as he was a fan of the&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Panic! at the Disco band</a>&nbsp;and its frontman, Brendon Urie, and telling&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>TresA Magazine&nbsp;</a>that year that he might start a band after more practice. He then revealed to his followers&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>in July 2023</a>&nbsp;that his cousin Brandon Appell works at a car dealership, Gaudin Porsche of Las Vegas, which allows him to sit in many luxurious vehicles. However, he liked the BMW 330i in Nardo Gray color the most, and might have purchased it after getting his&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>driver’s license in October 2022</a>. Preston revealed to&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>the “Good Morning America” host</a>&nbsp;that his grandfather used to take him to car shows with vehicles from the 1960s and the 1970s.</p><p>Preston has also been open about his charity efforts. In 2023, he supported the&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Compassion International</a>. Moreover, when his friend, gymnast&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Chloe Puckett, unexpectedly died on 27 April 2020</a>, Preston promoted a GoFundMe link to help her family cover the funeral costs. Preston told Review Journal that if “Secrets of Sulphur Springs” isn’t renewed for a fourth season, he would like to star in a Marvel or DC superhero movie. His second choice is to appear in an action movie or a Netflix series similar to “Stranger Things.”</p><h2><span id=Dating>Dating</span></h2><p>Preston Oliver hasn’t publicly dated anyone, although his fan base thinks he and his co-stars Madeleine McGraw and Kyliegh Curran would make cute couples.
