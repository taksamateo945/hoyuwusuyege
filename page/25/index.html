Experts fear a looming flashpoint between the Australian and Chinese military could spark a ‚Äòserious incident‚Äô after escalating confrontations over territorial claims.
The warning comes after the Australian Navy frigate HMAS Parramatta was stalked by Chinese aircraft, nuclear submarines and warships.
And on Wednesday, a US warship deliberately sailed within 12 miles of Chinese-claimed territory in the South China Sea in a direct challenge to Beijing.
It follows earlier clashes where Australian military aircraft were threatened by Chinese fighter jets using potentially dangerous flares and chaff, and another targeted by high-power military-grade Chinese lasers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Colts' Top 2024 NFL Draft Targets | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</h2><time>Mar 10, 2024</time>

However, they could use more at the position, and if one of the top wideouts‚ÄîOhio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., LSU's Malik Nabers or Washington's Rome Odunze‚Äîstarts to slide, the Indy could make its move. If the Colts stay put, however, they could be inclined to take the best value available. That may be on defense, even if general manager Chris Ballard is eager to aid Richardson.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How To Make Money On Steam In 2022 | 12 Legit Ways</h2><time>Mar 8, 2024</time>

Tua Tagovailoa was a first-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft, when he was selected No. 5 overall by the Miami Dolphins. His younger brother, Taulia, won't be a Day 1 pick in 2024, but some team could take a flier on him later in the draft, especially after seeing how he played Thursday.
There are a lot of strong quarterbacks in this year's draft, and quite a few could go in the first round.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/24/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
