In a new social media post the 60-year-old actress looks half her age, flaunting her incredibly fit figure in a bathing suit. "Sharing a few precious moments from my recent adventure with</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> @tilliewaltonofficial</span></a><span> and</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> @nash2o</span></a><span> on</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> #TilliesRiverTrip</span></a><span>. Back in September, I had the opportunity to journey through the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River alongside so many beautiful souls. We laughed, cried and formed lifelong bonds that I will hold close to my heart forever. I will never truly be able to describe the many ways that this recent nature immersion has impacted me. Standing on the banks of the Colorado River as we all took in its magnificence and beauty, I was reminded of the urgent need to preserve and protect this vital lifeline. Thank you Tillie for bringing us all together and showing us that we can advocate on nature's behalf. Let's be the change we want to see!" she captioned the Instagram post. What is Demi's secret to eternal youth? Celebwell rounded up some of her top health habits.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_2274038811.jpg><p><span>Demi refuses to let age define her. "It's changing this idea that women become less desirable as we get older," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span>. "We don't want to look matronly or not feel sexy." Her approach? "Not being defined by a number and instead being defined by my experience. You hit 59 and you're already thinking, 'Well, I'm going to be 60.' It feels very liberating. When I think of my grandmother at 60, she in a way seemed to be already resigned to being old. But I feel, in so many ways, more alive and present than ever."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_2316141357.jpg><p><span>Demi used to be a slave to her body. "I couldn't stop exercising…I would be on display again, and all I could think about was my body, my body, my body…I doubled down on my already over-the-top exercise routine. I cut out carbs, I ran and I biked and I worked out on every machine imaginable," she wrote in her 2019 autobiography, Inside Out. After G.I. Jane, she altered her approach. "I had reached my limit," she said. "When I got home to Idaho, I had an epiphany in the shower one day: I just need to be my natural size."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Demi is sober and has a new fix: Coffee. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic</span></a><span>, there are several benefits of drinking coffee in moderation. "It </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>acts on your brain</span></a><span> to improve memory, mood, reaction times, and mental function," they say, citing a s</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>tudy</span></a><span> finding that caffeine can improve endurance and performance during exercise. It is also antioxidant-rich, can ward off diabetes, prevent neurologic disease, lower cancer risk, and ward off depression, they point out.</span></p><p><span>Moore prefers working out at home with The Mirror, a virtual workout platform owned by Lululemon. She has shared videos of herself getting in a workout class via the tool. In this </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Instagram video,</span></a><span> she does planks, plie squats, and stretches.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The secret to anti-aging? "When you see people who are joyous and smiling, they look 10 years younger and share a light that you can't buy in a bottle," Moore told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>InStyle</span></a><span>. "I think there's always a parallel: What's going on within us usually is reflected on the outside."</span></p><p><span>Moore also prioritizes gut health by taking watermelon mint digestive tablets created by Wonderbelly. A gut antacid, that is a "known and needed product on the most clean level," she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifHp80magnKeeYrGmuchmpKinopp6tLTAq5ysZaOstq6%2F1KKrZqiYpMGwedSnm56qXZZ6uK3TnqmfmZyhfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanye-west-latest-news.html><span>←</span><span>Videos and Photos on We</span></a>
