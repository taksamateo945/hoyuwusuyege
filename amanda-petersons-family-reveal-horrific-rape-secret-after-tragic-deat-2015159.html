You have to be very well attuned to what your children are doing, what they’re saying,” he said. “We all have to be more aware, and that doesn’t diminish your love.”</p><p>Watch the heartbreaking interviews in the clip above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJimmZ6Zrm68xK2cq6ufo8BussCmoKWxXaeyt7HApWShp6Kntqe1wmapmqiVYsCmr9Geq2aZlqmys3nTq5igoZNisaat02ZpaWllZoJ6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roger-lodge.html><span>←</span><span>Roger Lodge</span></a>
