She stated:</p><p>“She was having a great time. She desired objectification.”</p><p>During the most recent episode of her podcast, The Megyn Kelly Show, the 51-year-old host said that she did not believe Markle’s claims about feeling like a bimbo since she knew precisely what she was getting herself into. She went on to say that Markle was attempting to “con” everyone and instead relished her time on the program as the briefcase girl.&nbsp;Meghan Markle admitted to feeling objectified while on Deal or No Deal, claiming that the program was more concerned with attractiveness than brains.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Meghan-Markle.jpg alt="Meghan Markle" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Megyn Kelly’s criticism of Meghan Markle’s statements sparks a response on Twitter</h2><p>Following Megyn Kelly’s criticism of Meghan Markle’s confession, Twitteratis chastised the talk show presenter for dismissing the Duchess of Sussex’s confession. Furthermore, people labeled her “racist” and “jealous” of Markle.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Some people work any job because they have bills to pay. Rent, car payments, tuition, medical insurance etc..

She desired adoration, and she still wants it to this day.”</p><p>Meghan Markle claimed on the newest edition of her Archetype podcast that, although she was grateful for the position, she left since it was more about looks than intellect:</p><p>“And there were various stations for getting your lashes applied, extensions applied, or bra padding applied. We were also given spray-tan coupons every week since there was a very specific vision of how we should appear. It was all about our looks. And not always about intellect.”</p><p>Markle said that she did not enjoy how the program made her feel as if she were stupid:</p><p>“On that platform, I was surrounded by intelligent ladies, but that wasn’t the reason we were there, and I would leave with a pit in my stomach. Knowing that I was so much more than the objectification on stage. I didn’t appreciate feeling compelled to be all show and no substance.”</p><p>Whoopi Goldberg and Meghan Markle’s former co-star, Claudia Jordan, both questioned neither Megyn Kelly nor Meghan Markle’s claims regarding her stint on Deal or No Deal.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknp%2Bpo3qssculsGaho2Kws7XTopqispWZeqe70Wafnqpdp7KurdGkqmannmK6prPHmqVmpZGnuK2x0mabnpmcYryzec2oZJ2dkaF6psTPnqminZ6YsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./extreme-wrath-html.html><span>←</span><span>Extreme wrath</span></a>
