Police are now trying to find Northrup, who is accused of conspiracy to commit organized fraud, which is a felony.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The families who contacted the I-TEAM all say tell us they were each required to give a down payment of 50% of the total cost of their fence job — paying anywhere from $1,600 to nearly $5,000 as a deposit. But they say Northrup gave them the runaround and never did the work he was paid to do.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF"><b>PREVIOUS I-TEAM STORY: </b><b>Customers out thousands of dollars after paying deposits for fence work that wasn’t done</b></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">In June, the I-TEAM went searching for Northrup and started at the business address for Father and Sons Fence Co. on 103rd Street. When we got there, we found the business gone and the lot being completely cleared. Court documents show Northrup had been evicted from the property.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">We finally did track Northrup down and he agreed to interview with us on camera. In that June interview, admitted to the I-TEAM he had dozens of customers he had taken money from but had not finished the work.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“We’re working hard to get it done. If they want their money, we’ll get it back to them,” Northrup said. “I’m not running from nobody, it’s just hard times right now.”</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“How are you going to get it back to them?” we asked.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“I’m selling stuff, trying to get a job done here and there, and I’m going to get their money back to them,” he answered.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“How many of those customers have you taken deposits from?” we asked.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“Maybe 30,” he answered.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“So how much do you think you’re in the hole?” we asked.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“Probably $25,000, $30,000,” he said.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">During that June interview, the 63-year-old told us he hoped to pay back all of his customers by the end of July.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“I apologize, you know. I didn’t know this was going to happen. I’m going to do whatever it takes to make things right, and I hope they understand,” said Northrup.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">It’s now August, and so far, none of the 12 customers we have spoken to have had their fences completed or had their money returned.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">If you know where police can find Northrup, call JSO’s non-emergency line at 904-360-0500 or email <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=c58f968a86b7aca8a091acb5b685afa4bdb6ada0b7aca3a3ebaab7a2>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>.
