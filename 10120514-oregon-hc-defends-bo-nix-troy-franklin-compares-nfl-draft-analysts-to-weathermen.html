"They don't have to be right. … Who cares what they think? It's about what kind of career he's going to have."</p><p>The Ducks stars had two very different experiences in the 2024 NFL draft, even though they wound up in the same place. Nix was selected with the No. 12 overall pick by the Denver Broncos. Franklin, who was regarded as a <a href=# rel=noopener>first-round prospect</a> by some analysts, fell to the Broncos in the fourth round.</p><p>Lanning, who noted the Broncos "got a steal" by trading up for Franklin, addressed some of the things he heard about why the standout receiver went much later than expected.</p><p>"I heard so many things about the guy doesn't love football," Lanning said. "I mean, the guy practices his tail off like football was what he was made for. That's what he does. He's an extremely intelligent player who is very smart and works hard to be really good."</p><p>"He's a tall, lanky receiver, which means he often struggles to sink his hips and explode out on certain routes like curls, comebacks and digs," Derrik Klassen wrote. "Franklin's skinny frame is also part of why his ability to win the ball in the air can be inconsistent against nastier cornerbacks."</p><p>Franklin's pre-draft weight of 176 pounds put him in the <a href=# rel=noopener>fifth percentile</a> of all wide receivers. His hand size of 8.75 inches ranks in the ninth percentile. He did fare better in some of the athletic testing with a time of 4.41 seconds in the 40-yard dash (82nd percentile) and 39-inch vertical jump (85th percentile).</p><p>Lanning believes Nix and Franklin staying together in the NFL will benefit both players:</p><p><i>"I think chemistry between a wideout and quarterback is so important and it's real hard to kind of get in rhythm with it just because of the time constraints of coaching nowadays. That makes it hard, so I think it will be an awesome connection for those two, no doubt. … Those guys have played a lot of football together. … Troy always was Bo's insurance blanket, where he always felt that if he could get the ball to Troy, he's going to have a chance to win."</i></p><p>The Ducks head coach praised Nix's "intelligence" as one of his top attributes, as well as his "competitive spirit" and "work ethic" as he moves into the NFL.</p><p>B/R's NFL scouting department was <a href=#>mixed</a> on Denver's draft class overall, giving it a C+ grade. Nix's selection was the primary reason for the grade, as he was the No. 61 overall player on the <a href=#>big board</a>.</p><p>Given the Broncos' need at quarterback and who was still on the board when their turn came up, it wasn't a surprise to see them go for Nix.</p><p>Maybe Broncos head coach Sean Payton will be proven right for <a href=# rel=noopener>believing</a> in Nix as much as he did Patrick Mahomes in the 2017 draft. Having a receiver who he already has an established connection with on the team should help him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmWCcoCMqKmen5%2BjeqmvjJ2cn52emcBurs5mpaKwXam%2FsMWMn6mappuhtq95wqikqZmimsBuusWlZJ2qkZvBbq3NmqOyq6SoerW7jLCcmqyYmr%2Busc0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./braxton-weidman-cause-of-death-2017.html><span>←</span><span>Braxton Weidman Obituary And Cause Of Death</span></a>
