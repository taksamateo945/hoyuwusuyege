Teasing the upcoming episode that will air on The Kelly Clarkson on October 28, 2019, Kelly posed with Lucifer cast members Aimee Garcia (Ella Lopez), Kevin Alejandro (Dan) and Tom Ellis who plays Lucifer. Kelly was bright, cheery and full of smiles as she sandwiched between the cast members.</p><p>Lucifer&nbsp;is a fan favorite and one of the shows that relied on its fan base to pull together and save it from certain death. When Fox announced it had canceled the series based on Neil Gaiman‚Äôs graphic novels, the show‚Äôs fans immediately launched a social media campaign to bring it back.</p><p>The hashtag #savelucifer trended and went viral across all social media platforms. Netflix heard the cry and brought Lucifer to its platform for a fourth season. A second viral campaign continued to seek a fifth season. Netflix announced they will bring Lucifer back for a fifth and final season that promises to bring fans the closure they didn‚Äôt receive when Fox abruptly ended the show.</p><p>You may see several photos featuring Kelly, Tom Ellis and cast members below.</p><p lang=art dir=ltr>üëÄüòà <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/AWmSKqgF2V</a></p><p>‚Äî Lucifer (@LuciferNetflix) <a href=# rel=nofollow>October 23, 2019</a></p><p>Showrunners Ildy Modrovich and Joe Henderson released a statement about Lucifer Season 5 being the last. You may read that below.</p><p>‚ÄúWe are so incredibly thankful to Netflix for resurrecting our show last season, and now letting us finish the story of Lucifer on our terms. Most importantly, we want to thank the fans for their incredible passion and support. The best is yet to come.‚Äù</p><p>Netflix hasn‚Äôt announced a release date for Lucifer Season 5 and many fans expect it to air in 2020. Hopefully, this will be one of the scoops that Kelly breaks when she talks about Lucifer on next Monday‚Äôs episode.</p><p>It‚Äôs expected that all of the main characters will return, but it is unclear whether Eve (played by Israeli beauty Inbar Lavi) will have a storyline. Inbar stunned during season 4 and quickly became a fan favorite. However; it seems likely that season 5 is going to be about Chloe‚Äôs and Lucifer‚Äôs love. Whether there will be room for Eve, if she is a major player, or if it will be easier to just go on without her remains a mystery.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Are you a fan of Lucifer?
