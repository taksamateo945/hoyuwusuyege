Stallone created a niche for himself in the Action genre and in all his appearances he has delivered more than hundred percent. One worth noting is the Rocky series from 1976 to 2015 where his character was the movie title and protagonist. The latest movie in the Rocky series is Creed (2015) where he won his first Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor.</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-ex-wife-sasha-czack.jpg fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4706 title="Sylvester Stallone with ex-wife Sasha Czack" alt="Sylvester Stallone’s family - ex-wife Sasha Czack" width=800 height=464 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-4706 class=wp-caption-text>Sylvester with Sasha Czack</p><p style=text-align:justify>In Sylvester’s seventy years on earth, he has been through three marriages; he had kids with two; <strong>Sasha Czack</strong> (married from 1974 to 1985) and <strong>Jennifer Flavin</strong> (married since 1997).

He was known as a horror film distributor.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-children-son-sage-stallone-5.jpg decoding=async title="Sylvester Stallone’s kid - son Sage" alt="Sylvester Stallone’s children - son Sage Stallone" width=800 height=653 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify>Sadly in 2012, Sage Stallone was found dead in his Los Angeles at the age of 36. About a month after his death, the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office mentioned that Sage died of a heart attack. Sage’s death shook his family as they all loved him and referred to him as the centre of their world. Who know how far he would have gone in the movie industry if death did not take him away.</p><h2>Sylvester Stallone children</h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Seargeoh Stallone</strong> (son, born to Sylvester Stallone and Sasha Czack)</p><p style=text-align:justify><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-children-son-Seargeoh-stallone.jpg decoding=async title="Sylvester Stallone with sons Seargeoh, Sage and then wife Sasha" alt="Sylvester Stallone’s children - son Seargeoh Stallone" width=800 height=467 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Year of Birth:</strong> 1979</p><p style=text-align:justify>Seargeoh is the handsome second son and the silent Stallone. He lives a very private life so much is not known about him. We think he couldn’t handle the hustle of his father’s celebrity status as he was diagnosed with autism at the young age of 3. We don’t know how much therapy Seargeoh has gotten but he has some experience in child acting.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-children-sons-sage-and-seargeoh-stallone-1.jpg decoding=async title="Sylvester Stallone’s sons Seargeoh and Sage" alt="Sylvester Stallone’s children - son Seargeoh Stallone" width=634 height=471 data-sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Sophia Stallone</strong> (daughter, born to Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Flavin)</p><p style=text-align:justify><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-children-daughter-Sophia-Stallone.jpg decoding=async title="Sylvester Stallone with daughter Sophia Stallone" alt="Sylvester Stallone’s children - daughter Sophia Stallone" width=800 height=470 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> August 27, 1996</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Virgo</p><p style=text-align:justify>She is one of the three pretty girls in the Sly family brood. Of late they have become regular faces on social media. Sophia the first girl and is currently a student at the University of Southern California. The same year when Sage sadly died, Sophia had to go in for a heart surgery to correct a congenital valve defect.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her mother Jennifer Flavin says Sophia resembles her father the most. I don’t think you should also be surprised to know that Sophia is the love of his life. We have seen severally how fathers literally adore their first daughters. Stallone has proven to be just like every other man in this regard. Who can fault him when they both think alike and have very similar gestures?</p><p style=text-align:justify>The first female Stallone is a lover of books and movies. In fact, she has read nearly all of Shakespeare’s books.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Sistene Stallone</strong> (daughter, born to Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Flavin)</p><p style=text-align:justify><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-children-daughter-Sistene-Stallone.jpg decoding=async title="Sylvester Stallone with daughter Sistene Stallone" alt="Sylvester Stallone’s children - daughter Sistene Stallone" width=800 height=543 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> June 27, 1998</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Cancer</p><p style=text-align:justify>Sophia already took after her father so when Sistene came on board she interestingly chose another path to follow. Sistene is the middle child of Jennifer Flavin and has decided to follow her mother’s path. She sees herself as a terrible actress and is an aspiring model and has been called by Vogue “a fresh face to watch”.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As much as Sistene did not take after her father, she needed her father’s fame in her rise to prominence. So many people know her because she is a Stallone. Sistene is glad for this opportunity but she hopes to create a name for herself soonest.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Scarlet Stallone</strong> (daughter, born to Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Flavin)</p><p style=text-align:justify><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-children-daughter-Scarlet-Stallone.jpg decoding=async title="Sylvester Stallone with daughter Scarlet Stallone" alt="Sylvester Stallone’s children - daughter Scarlet Stallone" width=799 height=567 data-sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> May 25, 2002</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Gemini</p><p style=text-align:justify>Oh Goodness! This was the first thing I said when I saw a picture of Sylvester Stallone and his last child. Scarlet is the female version of what Sylvester would have been as a young child. The Stallone baby shares a striking resemblance with her celebrity dad.</p><p style=text-align:justify>One time her father shared a video of her on Instagram winning in a track race. This goes to show that Scarlet did not just inherit his looks; she also inherited her father’s athletic abilities.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-children-daughters.jpg decoding=async title="Sylvester Stallone with daughter" alt="Sylvester Stallone’s children - daughters" width=800 height=412 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sylvester-stallone-family-children-daughters-and-wife-1-1.jpg decoding=async title=" Sylvester Stallone’s daughters and wife" alt=" Sylvester Stallone’s family - daughters and wife" width=594 height=395 data-sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaeqS0yKWbq52eYravedOhnGarqaHDpr%2FTnqlmq6SWua27zZ6qZp6RoratxYybqainlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ammika-harris-shares-an-important-message-with-fans-471373.html><span>←</span><span>Ammika Harris Shares An Important Message With Fans</span></a>
