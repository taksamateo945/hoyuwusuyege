It's a work in progress, but feeling pretty good bout my first Sam Howell in a Seahawks uniform... &lt;a href="https://t.co/c16UKpJKM4">pic.twitter.com/c16UKpJKM4&lt;/a></p><p>It seemed like at the very least Lock had a <a href=# rel=noopener>puncher's chance</a> of beating out Smith with Wilson gone. Then Smith not only won the starting job but also went on to claim Comeback Player of the Year.</p><p>The circumstances are a little different this time around, though.</p><p>Firing Pete Carroll and hiring Mike Macdonald as head coach signaled the start of a new era for the organization, one in which general manager John Schneider might be taking a longer view.</p><p>Smith is coming off a second straight Pro Bowl, but his performance did dip a little bit in 2023. His completion percentage (64.7), yards per game (241.6) and QBR (59.5) were all slightly below their 2022 equivalents.</p><p>Should the 33-year-old regress further as next season unfolds, Macdonald may feel less wedded to keeping him as the starter than Carroll would've.</p><p>The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeff Howe</a> reported on March 16 "the Seahawks have been high on Howell for a while." Additionally, "teams like the Seahawks have been intrigued by Howell's ability to step into the starting lineup with minimal experience and attempt the most passes in the NFL."</p><p>Seattle presumably wouldn't have moved for the 2022 fifth-round pick if it didn't envision a scenario in which he'd be QB1 in the short- or long-term future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWiFd4KMp52lZaKqurC%2B0maqnpmYlsSsv4yipayhlJq%2FbrHXqZycrKNiwKK5jKGmsJ2coXq1u4yprKygXZyyr7uMrKSirJhis7C%2BjKyrmqqknruoecmomQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicki-minaj-and-tekashi-69s-new-video-makes-history-it-gained-the-most-views-in-hip-hop-in-less-than-24-hours-406240.html><span>←</span><span>Nicki Minaj And Tekashi 69s New Video Makes History!
