The Dexter alum, 35, recently welcomed her first child with fiance <strong>Seth Avett</strong>, she confirmed at CBS' Television Critics Association event on Monday, Aug. 10.</p><p>Carpenter was at the TCAs to promote her new show, Limitless, based on the 2011 <strong>Bradley Cooper</strong> film of the same name. While on stage, she admitted she knew she was pregnant before she got the role.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was without a doubt — I was pregnant. I got the script and I thought, I just want to throw my hat in the ring. Knowing that the odds of getting it in my condition were just next to none," the first-time mom recalled.</p><p>"I sent it in with an apology, if I'm being honest," she continued. "It was me and my fiance at our kitchen table having a good time. So when my manager called and said, 'They'd like you to do it…' I'm still kind of adjusting to the idea."</p><p>By the time they filmed the pilot, she said, she was already eight-and-a-half months along.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"We have an incredible costume designer," the actress gushed. "He worked miracles. I'm actually wearing something in the second episode that we tried to wear in the first around my pregnant belly. I don't know if he's a magician or what, but it's Marc Webb's camera angles, people crossing at the right time."</p><p>Carpenter's rep confirmed to Us Weekly back in February that the star was pregnant and engaged. She and Avett — a member of the Avett Brothers — have been dating since June 2013.</p><p>"Jennifer met Seth about four years ago at a concert," an insider previously told<strong> Us Weekly</strong> of Carpenter, who was married to her Dexter costar <strong>Michael C. Hall </strong>from 2008 to 2011. "She loves music and has always been a big supporter of the band."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGepp6es6a%2BjJyYq6iVo8GmvoywnKWbn6KytHnBmpmyZaeewal5xaKYp5uVYsCmwMdmmK%2BdpKl6c3yQbmhpcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./genesis-ali-dean.html><span>←</span><span>Genesis Ali Dean: Family Member, Age, Birthday, Parents, Siblings, Net Worth, Bio</span></a>
