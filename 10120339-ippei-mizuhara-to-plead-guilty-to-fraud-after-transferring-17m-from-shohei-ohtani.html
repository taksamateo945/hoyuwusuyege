The bank fraud count carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison, while the false tax return count carries a sentence of up to three years.</p><p>A Wednesday report from ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Tisha Thompson</a> revealed Mizuhara paid his gambling debts by wiring money to Ryan Boyajian, who is a cast member of the reality television show <i>The Real Housewives of Orange County</i>.</p><p>Boyajian is also an associate of Mathew Bowyer, who is under investigation as an illegal bookmaker.</p><p>According to the report, Boyajian would forward the money wired from Mizuhara into accounts at casinos in Las Vegas and Southern California. He and Bowyer withdrew the money from those accounts via chips and then gambled with them with the hopes of cashing out any winnings.</p><p>As for Mizuhara, <a href=# rel=noopener>Holly Yan and Cindy Von Quednow</a> of CNN reported on April 12 that he surrendered to federal authorities and was released on $25,000 bond. He was also required to receive gambling addiction treatment and surrender his passport.</p><p>He allegedly impersonated Ohtani to acquire wire transfers and used some of the money to, as officials put it, drive his "voracious appetite for illegal sports betting" that saw him gamble approximately 19,000 times between December 2021 and January 2024.</p><p>Last month, Ohtani <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a>, "The investigation is currently still going on, so I can't really say much about that. But it made me really realize how supportive the teammates, the organization, the staff have been towards me. It's just allowed me to really reflect on how grateful I am to be surrounded by them."</p><p>Ohtani is playing his first year of a 10-year deal he signed with the Dodgers this past offseason.</p><p>He has been excellent through 37 games with a .365/.435/.696 slash line, 11 home runs, 27 RBI and nine stolen bases. He leads MLB in batting average, slugging percentage, OPS (1.131), home runs (11), hits (54) and doubles (14).</p><p>Los Angeles is in first place in the National League West at 25-13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmWAdIWMoqepnZliuqrG1KGYq5ldqbxuvMuemJ1ll6q2rcDYZquoZZanrrawjJqdrZ2iYsGzrc2snZ6qop67qHmQcKRmnqKkum6%2Fx6ifnqFdpLW1rc2i</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./to-be-tied-irate-html.html><span>←</span><span>___ to be tied (irate)</span></a>
