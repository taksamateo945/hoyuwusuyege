<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Livia Brito Shares Swimsuit Video Looking &amp;quot;Beautiful&amp;quot;</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Livia Brito is posing with an avocado – in her swimsuit. In a new social media post the Cuban-Mexican actress shows off her amazing body in a bathing suit while revealing her favorite fruit. "And you what about," she captioned the series of Instagram snaps. "Linda," commented one of her followers, which translates to pretty. "You look beautiful, beautiful, super beautiful, pretty princess," added another. How does the 37-year-old stay fit? Celebwell rounded up her top lifestyle tips.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Livia.Brito_.png><p><span>Livia makes sure to work out daily. "My exercise routine takes time, generally 40 to 45 minutes," she told Women Fitness. "First work 10 min on the abdomen. Then 7 repetitions of squats, each series of 12. After 12 min of burpees, 3 burpees per min."</span></p><p><span>Livia's diet is clean and healthy. She starts her day with a breakfast of eggs. For lunch and dinner? "I like to eat salmon with vegetables," she said.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/shutterstock_1727823436.jpg><p><span>In order to get the nutrients she needs, Livia supplements. She takes a pack of collagen daily. She also makes protein shakes. "Getting back into my habits and here I am making a rich protein," she captioned a recent </span><span>post</span><span> of herself."</span></p><p><span>Livia also enjoys boxing. "My day always starts with good energy my babies of light. How's your weekend going?" she captioned a post of herself with gloves on. Fitness boxing has many health benefits, "because it constantly requires you to think, change your position, and change your posture," physical therapist Linda Arslanian, director of rehabilitation services at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's hospital tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>."You're swinging your arms, moving the muscles of your arms and shoulders, increasing your upper-body strength. And when you're in the boxer crouch with a wide stance, with your knees slightly bent, you're strengthening your core muscles, back, and legs."</span></p><p><span>Livia understands the importance of self-care. "Relaxing Sunday babies… sometimes disconnecting does us really good; The mind calms down and the heart opens up even more. Enjoy your Sunday," she captioned a post.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK211aKYZpqinsGwedKhmKudo2LAuLXMrKyirF2rtqWxzmajqKebnruoecGemK6smZvCrXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./delivered-a-tirade-html.html><span>←</span><span>Delivered a tirade</span></a>
