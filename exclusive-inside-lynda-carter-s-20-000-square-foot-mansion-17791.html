It’s a pretty active house, and I’ve always got something going on,” Lynda says, adding that her children, Jessica, 23, and James, 25, are always still around.</p><p>“The guys are always downstairs where the large TV is, and there’s a card table and a pool table, too,” says Lynda, who is going to be back on the small screen when she guest-stars on CBS’ “Two and a Half Men” on Nov. 7.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1345-bedroom.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8SxmqWto57DpnnIp6qinJViubq6w5pknJmiqbKzedJmaWllYGV9br%2FQrpirnV2bvLDAjKaYp6uZpLtufZZwcGo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ethan-cruikshank.html><span>←</span><span>Ethan Cruikshank- Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth &amp;amp; Career</span></a>
