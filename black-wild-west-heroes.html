Though Matthews was just 15, two years too young, he managed to enlist as a Buffalo Soldier himself shortly thereafter.</p><p>Matthews went first to Fort Huachuca, Arizona for training. “I learned all the different rules, how to ride the different horses, how to jump, and how to shoot,” he said, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to the Washington Post</a>. “Every time I got in a contest where I shot at a target or something, I usually won.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-381885 alt="Buffalo Soldiers In 1890" width=900 height=571 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/buffalo-soldiers-in-1890.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-381885 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span><span class=caption-body>Members of the Buffalo Soldiers, pictured in 1890.</span></p><p>In 1916, Matthews also participated in General John J. Pershing’s ongoing pursuit of the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. “I never met him,” he would later recall, “but I knew where he was at.”</p><p>Though the days of the Wild West had ended, Mark Matthews continued to serve his country. In the 1930s, he helped train military recruits in horsemanship and even worked in President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s stables. And when World War II broke out, Matthews saw action in the South Pacific.</p><p>Matthews died in 2005 at age 111 as one of the nation’s last surviving Buffalo Soldiers. By then, the Buffalo Soldiers had long since disbanded (they were integrated into other units in 1952) and the Wild West had become a tame labyrinth. But the heroic legacy of this all-Black Wild West unit lives on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyjuMCcomavmaGxbsPErKtmoJWnvKa%2FjnE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1226855-park-chu-young-a-look-into-one-of-the-strangest-arsenal-signings.html><span>←</span><span>Park Chu-Young: A Look into One of the Strangest Arsenal Signings | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats,</span></a>
