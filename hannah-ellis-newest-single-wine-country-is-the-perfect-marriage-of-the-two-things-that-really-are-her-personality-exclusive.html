And as of June 9th, Hannah’s hot new track has been on <span>everyone’s</span> summer playlist, with plans to be climbing the charts in no time.</p><p>According to a <a href=#>recent press release</a> from her record label, <strong>Curb Records</strong>, “The pop-country twang of ‘Wine Country’ raises a glass to the 2023 ‘<a href=#><strong>CMT</strong></a> LISTEN UP’ artist, proving the old adage true: You can take the girl out of the country, but you can’t take the country out of the girl.”</p><p>Within the music video, “Ellis sips her Cabernet from a Solo Cup, while wearing her black Luccheses on the cleverly penned track she wrote with <strong>Clint Lagerberg</strong> and her husband, <strong>Nick Wayne</strong>,” ultimately creating the perfect mixture of classy and country.</p><p>The sassy new single serves as a follow up to some of the budding songstress’ recent releases, from “<a href=#>Someone Else’s Heartbreak</a>” to “<a href=#>Country Can</a>” and beyond, ultimately gearing up for a full-length project in the VERY near future.</p><p>After chatting ALL about “Someone Else’s Heartbreak” <a href=#>back in February</a>, <strong>Celeb Secrets</strong> reporter <a href=#><strong>Melanie Rooten</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>caught up with Hannah Ellis once again, but this time at the 50th Annual <a href=#><strong>CMA Fest</strong></a>. The budding songstress gushed about her brand new single “Wine Country,” and she even gave us some behind-the-scenes secrets surrounding her forthcoming album.</p><p>When asked how exactly “Wine Country” came to be, Hannah Ellis revealed that she “actually wrote it with [her] husband, Nick Wayne, and [their] friend Clint Lagerburg, and it was Clint’s idea.”</p><p>“He’s like, ‘You know, I have this idea called ‘Wine Country.’ I think it’d be so fun for, you know, a female artist,’ and my husband just turns and looks at me and he’s like, ‘This is your anthem,’ because it’s so my personality,” she gushed.</p><p>“I’m a girl from a small town in Kentucky, but I do like to get a little boujee sometimes, and so it’s just this perfect marriage of the two things that really are my personality, but are in so many of us,” the talented singer-songwriter concluded with a smile.</p><p>If you love “Wine Country,” it is important to know that this hot new track is just a tiny glimpse into <span>everything</span> that is on the way…</p><p>“I have a whole album that we’ve been really working on for the last year or so, and I cannot wait for people to hear it. It’s so close to being done,” she teased.</p><p>When asked what the inspiration is behind the new album, Hannah gave us an inside look into her creative process, ultimately sharing with Celeb Secrets,&nbsp;“I just try to pull from real life a lot, so I’ve got everything from my sister’s breakup to my own marriage to just things that happened in our friends’ lives, and I think that is really where I draw inspiration from.”</p><p>With a little dash of everything, we know that Hannah Ellis’ highly-anticipated album will be nothing short of incredible!</p><a title=@hannahgreyellis href=#>@hannahgreyellis</a><p>Replying to @JessSand “Wine Country” OUT NOW! ❤️ <a title=cmafest href=#>#cmafest</a> <a title=newmusicfriday href=#>#newmusicfriday</a> <a title=countrymusic href=#>#countrymusic</a> <a title=winecountry href=#>#winecountry</a> <a title=boujeecountry href=#>#boujeecountry</a></p><p><a title="♬ Wine Country (Chorus) - Hannah Ellis" href=#>♬ Wine Country (Chorus) – Hannah Ellis</a></p><p>With a full-length project “so close to being done,” the rising country star has been hand picking the songs that will be the record, which comes with a great deal of pressure.</p><p>When asked how she gets the courage to release TONS of new tunes that are so personal to her, as well as those around her, Hannah revealed to us, “I think I’ve just always been a really empathetic person. For anybody that cares, I’m an Enneagram Two, which basically just means that I really do feel other people’s emotions and I can meet them in that, and I think that’s what makes my songwriting special.”</p><p>“I want [my listeners] to feel seen, because I think that is why I got into to writing songs and performing… Someone put out music sometime that said a message that I needed to hear, and that made me feel less alone in my moments,” she dished.</p><p>We can’t wait to hear ALL of the new music that Hannah Ellis has on the horizon, but until then, be sure to check out our <span>exclusive</span> interview with her from <a href=#><strong>CMA Fest 2023</strong></a> below.</p><p>If you like what you see, be sure to connect with the emerging artist on Twitter <a href=#>@hannahgreyellis</a>, Instagram <a href=#>@hannahgreyellis</a> and TikTok <a href=#>@hannahgreyellis</a> so you can stay up-to-date on ALL of the exciting things that she has on the way.</p><p>Afterwards, be sure to send us a tweet at <a href=#>@celebsecrets</a> and/or leave a comment at the bottom of this post to let us know your how excited you are for Hannah’s upcoming album — We want to know your thoughts!</p><p><strong>LISTEN TO “WINE COUNTRY” HERE:</strong></p><p><i>For more coverage from CMA Fest 2023, click </i><a href=#>HERE</a><i>.&nbsp;</i>For more Country news, visit <a href=#>CelebSecretsCountry.com</a>.</p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span> <span class="ppma-category-group ppma-category-group-"><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_melanie has-avatar" readability=3.8374455732946><img data-del=avatar alt="Melanie Rooten" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_5785-Small-96x96.jpeg height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Originally from Southern California and currently residing in Music City, Melanie graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a BA in Journalism before beginning her career as a music and entertainment journalist.
