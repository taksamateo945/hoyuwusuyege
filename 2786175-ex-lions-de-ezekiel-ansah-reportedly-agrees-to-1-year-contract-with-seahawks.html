For Ansah, it followed a familiar pattern, as he's alternated big seasons with down years since 2015:</p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li><strong>2015:</strong> 14.5 sacks, four forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries in 16 games (Pro Bowl selection)</li><li><strong>2016:</strong> 2.0 sacks in 13 games</li><li><strong>2017:</strong> 12.0 sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery in 14 games</li><li><strong>2018:</strong> 4.0 sacks in seven games</li></ul><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Rothstein</a> of ESPN.com noted in December, "In his six seasons with Detroit after being drafted fifth overall out of BYU, Ansah has dealt with shoulder, ankle, knee and biceps injuries—including a shoulder surgery in 2014 and a knee cleanout this past offseason."</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Schefter</a> reported on Thursday morning that "<span>Ansah still is recovering from shoulder surgery that is expected to keep him out of training camp or longer; some league sources believe Ansah could miss the first month of this season, at least."</span></p><p>The Lions and Ansah couldn't agree to an extension before the 2018 campaign, with Detroit instead choosing to slap the franchise tag on him. That was never a likelihood again in 2019, however, and Ansah hit the market.</p><p>When he's healthy and on his game, he's one of the NFL's better edge-rushers, and the Seahawks will be hoping that's the player they get in 2019. Based on how his past four seasons have played out, he's due for a big campaign.</p><p><span><span><span>With Frank Clark traded to the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> this offseason, the Seahawks needed to bolster the pass rush. The team did address the edge in the draft, adding L.J. Collier in the first round, but adding a veteran like Ansah made sense for Seattle.</span></span></span></p>Adam Schefter <span class=acct>@AdamSchefter</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Former Lions’ DE Ziggy Ansah is expected to sign with the Seattle Seahawks, per a league source. Seattle lands a veteran DE to help offset the loss of DE Frank Clark, who was traded to KC.</p><p><span><span><span>Ansah isn't as good as Clark at this point in his career, not by a long shot, but if he can regain his 2017 form he could be a very nice addition for the Seahawks.</span></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXBwZmaEdnnEsWSloZ%2BjwG6wxGacs52bnrKtecCnqpqgXaeysbvRrZydpKlirqi%2BxJ6qZqyfYn5uxcSaqWabn6PBs63CrWSwoaSderSxwKGYsKOj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megyn-kelly-is-criticized-for-her-remarks-on-meghan-markles-deal-or-no-deal-experience.html><span>←</span><span>Megyn Kelly Is Criticized For Her Remarks On Meghan Markles Deal or No Deal Experience</span></a>
