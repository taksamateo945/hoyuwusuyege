Unlike the six live-action movies that follow Milla Jovovich’s hero, Alice, the <a href=#>TV show</a> focuses on Albert Wesker and his two daughters, Billie and Jade.&nbsp;</p><p>Rudolph plays an adult Billie in the reboot. The teen version of the character is portrayed by young actor Siena Agudong.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=1.6614173228346><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIdjcDTc9Vk</a><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIdjcDTc9Vk?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p>In <a href=#>this iteration of Resident Evil</a>, Albert is an Umbrella Corp. scientist who develops an antidepressant that ultimately becomes the delivery method for the zombie-causing T-virus. When he first moves his family to New Racoon City, Billie finds it hard to fit in.&nbsp;</p><p>But she’s a fiercely compassionate person and an animal rights advocate. And upon learning that Umbrella Corp. is testing drugs on animals, Billie finds herself in deep trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>“Ultimately, it’s about a girl … who had to go through a lot of turmoil [and has] a loving but also complicated relationship with her sister and her father,” Rudolph told <a href=#>Collider</a> about her character.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where else can you see Adeline Rudolph?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Resident Evil isn’t Rudolph’s first Netflix series. The actor also starred in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa’s <a href=#>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</a>, in which she portrayed Agatha Night, a Weird Sister and peer of Kiernan Shipka’s Sabrina.</p><p>But that wasn’t the only project Rudolph did with Aguirre-Sacasa. She had a brief recurring role as Minerva Marble in season 5 of his CW drama, <a href=#>Riverdale</a>. Resident Evil is Rudolph’s third Hollywood project.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>EXCLUSIVE: Jake Manley, Adeline Rudolph, Francesca Reale, Laurence O’Faurain, Nicholas Hamilton, Javier Botet, Skylan Brooks and Kai Caster are joining Suretone Pictures and Lionsgate’s adventure horror thriller ‘Creepers’ <a href=#>https://t.co/5AroGtYvAt</a></p><p>— Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) <a href=#>July 29, 2022</a></p></figure><p>Next up for the actor is the adventure/horror movie Creepers, which recently began filming in Bulgaria.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, “Creepers&nbsp;follows a group of young urban explorers who plan to investigate an old, boarded-up, seemingly abandoned hotel, only to encounter danger at every turn in the form of a competing group of hostile urban explorers seeking to find a legendary hidden treasure — as well as a supernatural being who wreaks havoc on all.”</p><h2>Adeline Rudolph: Age, hometown, boyfriend, Instagram, and more</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Rudolph was born on Feb. 10, 1995, in Hong Kong to a Korean mother and German father.
