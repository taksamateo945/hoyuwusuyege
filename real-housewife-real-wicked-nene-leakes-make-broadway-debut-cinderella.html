Not to mention that Stuart Weitzman made the glass slippers I’ll be wearing.”</p><p>The show will be directed by Mark Brokaw and, according to Broadway.com, this won’t be your average Cinderella story.</p><p>“This Cinderella features a completely re-imaged book by (playwright) Douglas Carter Beane and additional Rodgers and Hammerstein songs originally composed for other musicals,” Broadway.com reports.</p><p>No reports have been able to confirm why Shepherd has decided not to perform for the entire show run.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX51e49yZmltX6eyoriMoaauq5WstqexjKucmqRdrLakt8SdZKednpp6rbHApJysZZ2WuKZ5waummpynlsZusMSbrK1lk567pbHRnqOlmV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./regina-lasko-all-about-the-wife-of-david-letterman.html><span>←</span><span>Regina Lasko- All About The Wife Of David Letterman</span></a>
