She was quoted as saying “Rocky is most like me, his mommy. He’s really cool and calm and goes with the flow”.

She soon found out Princess had health problems that needed surgery and constant care. Due to Kim’s busy schedule, she wasn’t able to keep her, but luckily her vet’s assistant took Princess in.</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kim-Kardashian-Mercy-195x195.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian's pet Mercy" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Mercy (Cat)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Fluffy White Cat</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted 2012</span></span><p>Mercy the cat was a gift from Kanye West to Kim in 2012, which Kim named after a song Kanye released at that time. Unfortunately Kim found out she was allergic to Mercy, so she was given to her sister Khloe’s assistant who cat had recently passed away. Soon after, Mercy was found unconscious and rushed to an animal hospital.</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kim-Kardashian-Goldfish-195x195.png alt="Kim Kardashian's pet Goldfish" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Goldfish (Fish)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Goldfish</span></span><p>While Kim’s daughter North has been asking for a puppy, Kim has started her off with five goldfish.

No one is sure why Bella went to go live with Pastor Brad, and the mystery surrounding the Jenner-Kardashian pets seems to grow. We hope you’re happy with your new family, Bella!</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kendall-Jenner-Simba-195x195.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian's pet Simba" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Simba (Dog)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Pomeranian</span></span><p>She has a Pomeranian named Simba.</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kim-Kardashian-Pomeranians-Sushi-and-Sake-195x195.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian's pet Sushi and Sake" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Sushi and Sake (Dog)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Pomeranian</span></span><p>Kim Kardashian has two Pomeranians with Japanese cuisine-themed names: The beige Pom is Sushi and the white Pom is Sake.</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/North-West-bearded-dragon-speed-195x195.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian's pet Speed" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Speed (Reptile)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Bearded Dragon</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted Mar 2021</span></span><p>Kim Kardashian’s daughter North West has a Bearded Dragon lizard named Speed.

Soba the black Pom hasn’t been seen since or mentioned by Kim since, with only Sake and her beige Pom Sushi appearing on her Instagram. It’s assumed Soba was rehomed to someone outside her direct family as the pup hasn’t appeared on any of her sisters’ social media accounts.</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kylie-Jenner-with-Kardashian-family-chihuahua-named-Dolce-195x195.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian's pet Dolce" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Dolce (Dog)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Chihuahua</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted 2005</span></span><p>Dolce the Chihuahua was a family pet of the Kardashians and was seen on the early seasons of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Dolce joined the Kardashian family around 2005, along with their Labrador Gabbana. Dolce went missing in 2012 and it was assumed a coyote killed him. Dolce is seen here with Kylie.</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Khloe-Kardashian-Gabbana-195x195.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian's pet Gabbana" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Gabbana (Dog)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Labrador</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted 2005</span></span><p>The Kardashian family got Gabbana in 2005, along with their late chihuahua Dolce. Gabbana was one of the longest-running Kardashian family pets. After her parent’s divorce, Khloe took Gabbana in. Gabbana unfortunately passed away in 2018. After her passing, Kris Jenner attempted to give Khloe three identical new puppies, but Khloe found the pups alternative homes. Apparently, no new puppies can fill Gabbana’s place in the Kardashian home. RIP Gabbana!</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West-14-Freesian-Horses-195x195.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian's pet 14 Friesian Horses" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>14 Friesian Horses (Horse)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Friesian</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted Jul 2019</span></span><p>In July 2020, Kim Kardashian tweeted that Kanye West and her added 14 Friesian horses to their Wyoming ranch in 2019. Note Friesian horses <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can cost between $7,000 to $600,000 each</a>, making 14 quite the invoice.</p><p>Friesian horses are a ancient horse breed originating from Friesland, a province in the northern Netherlands. Known for their striking appearance, these horses are characterized by a solid, muscular build, a thick mane and tail, and a shiny black coat. What makes Friesians truly special is their graceful and powerful movement, which, along with their elegant and regal appearance, makes them highly sought after for dressage, show driving, and as carriage horses.</p><h2 class=single__celeb-profile__title>Kim Kardashian</h2><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kim-Kardashian-250x250.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian Pets" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h4>Birthday</h4><p>October 21, 1980 (43)</p><p>Kim Kardashian is an American reality TV star, socialite, entrepreneur, social media influencer, entrepreneur, and model.
