<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Lisa Rinna in Bathing Suit is a &amp;quot;Mood&amp;quot; Celebwell</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>At 58, Lisa Rinna still rocks a swimsuit like a model. In the latest Instagram shared by the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, she shows off her phenomenal figure in an animal print swimsuit, looking decades young. "Mood," she captioned the seductive snap. How does the star keep herself so fit? Read on to see 6 of Lisa Rinna's top tips for staying in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Lisa promotes an active lifestyle, which means she makes movement a daily affair. "I'm always doing something. I just do because I feel better," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>OWN</span></a><span>. "If I feel better, I'm nicer. If I'm nicer, my life goes better." "<span>The goal is to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity. One way to do this is to try to fit in at least 20 to 25 minutes of activity every day. Also, on 2 or more days a week, include activities that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms)," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>CDC</a>.</span></span></p><p><span>Even if you can't make it to a class, do a workout video a la Lisa. "When I was 16, I discovered jazzercise. And I thought it was the greatest thing since peanut butter and jelly," she dished to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Parade</span></a><span>. She also sweat to Jane Fonda workout videos. "Oh, God. I loved that so much." In 2008, Lisa released her very own, called </span><i><span>Dance Body Beautiful</span></i><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/shutterstock_1014051754.jpg><p><span>Lisa tries to maintain a very plant-based lifestyle. "I tend to call myself a dirty vegan," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span>. "I'm mostly plant-based—but if I do need to eat some meat, I'll have it." "<span>When your meals include meat, don't overindulge. Choose lean cuts and avoid oversized portions. A serving of protein should be no more than 3 ounces (85 grams) — or about the size of a deck of cards — and should take up no more than one-fourth of your plate. Vegetables and fruits should cover half your plate. Whole grains make up the rest," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>.</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/GettyImages-1357792209.jpg><p><span>Lisa is one of the many stars who allows herself to indulge every once and awhile.&nbsp; "I don't love to use the word diet because if I do, I'll just want to eat 10 times more," she explained to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span>. "Moderation is key." That goes for even healthy foods. "<span>Tuna might be a protein-packed food that fits in well on sandwiches and in salads, but too much of it is a bad thing. The reason? Mercury. Canned tuna tends to be higher in mercury than most other fish, and eating too much of it can lead to vision problems, muscle weakness, and even pregnancy problems," says our sister site <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Eat This, Not That!</a></span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/GettyImages-1355009676.jpg><p><span>Lisa stresses the importance of making healthy living a lifestyle, not a trend. "For me, staying in shape has always been a part of my life, and it's all about consistency," Lisa told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>OWN</span></a><span>. "I've worked out my whole life." "<span>Starting a fitness program may be one of the best things you can do for your health. After all, physical activity can reduce your risk of chronic disease, improve your balance and coordination, help you lose weight, and even boost your self-esteem. And you can reap these benefits regardless of your age, sex or physical ability," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>.</span></span></p><p><span>If you enjoy exercise, you are more likely to do it, suggests Lisa. "My one piece of advice though is finding more than one form of exercise that you love to do and then mixing it up," she wrote on her </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>website</span></a><span>. "One day do the Pilates, and then the next day you play tennis. Maybe you can even incorporate a Friday night salsa dancing class with your girlfriends!"</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpaGjlnqztc2nmGahnmKvosDHoqWgZaOqtrV5yKxkmmWdpLylew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bitter-offering-at-a-brewpub-abbr-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bitter offering at a brewpub: Abbr.</span></a>
