When quizzed about when he plans on continuing his commitments in <a href=#>South Africa</a>, he said he has no interest yet.</p><p class=align-left>But, Mr Brown told <strong>Briefly News</strong> that none of this is true.</p>"Nothing is true. This is just them trying to push their content using my name."<h2>Mr Brown will be embarking on a different city tour</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>music</a> producer said he is too busy working with big stars such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Akon</a> and David Guetta even to be bothered by the news.</p><p class=align-left>He will also be embarking on tour and is still set on releasing his album.</p>"I am working on my USA, Italy and Australia tour.

Some in good terms, some in bad ways. But nothing stops me from making progress."Currently, I am nominated Africa Entertainment Music Awards USA, and I will also be performing in Tanzania at Kendwa Rocks Zanzibar."<h2>Mr Brown breaks things off with Itu Bokaba</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News </strong>previously reported that former <i>Rhythm City</i> actress Itu Bokaba and Open Mic producer Mr Brown <a href=#>reportedly broke up</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Allegedly, Itu never knew that Mr Brown was married, and she only found out in the media, like everybody else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKa6056prZmZo7qmutNomp6klZe%2FqsDInqpoaWdlhXh%2BjKapZpqipMSvecOema6mm6h6pLjAoqSsZZSavbC%2B05qroqeeYrCtrcimqmaZXai6pq3RZpqapaCWtqi6jKGgpmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordyn-woods-is-featured-in-rick-ross-video-and-fans-congratulate-her-306531.html><span>←</span><span>Jordyn Woods Is Featured In Rick Ross Video And Fans Congratulate Her</span></a>
