The songstress has been at the top of her game over the past twelve months, releasing hits including ‘Anywhere’, ‘Lonely Together’ with Avicii, and ‘For You’ with Liam Payne in addition to a <a href=#>soon-to-be-released all female collab</a> with Cardi B, Charli XCX, and Bebe Rexha. We can’t wait to see Rita slay the stage once more this year.</p><p>Also announced today was DJ <strong>Sigala</strong>, who will be bringing the summer vibes to Wembley. With hits such as ‘Lullaby’, ‘Came Here For Love’ and ‘Easy Love’ under his belt, there’s no doubt that Sigala will make sure that the entire crowd is bouncing.</p><p>Returning for a second year is&nbsp;<strong>Raye.&nbsp;</strong>After making her Ball debut last summer with Jax Jones, this time she will be performing in her own right. We’ve got our fingers crossed for a performance of her latest single ‘Cigarette’ which also features fellow STB artists Mabel and Stefflon Don.</p><p>Rapper <strong>G-Eazy</strong> will also be heading to this year’s Summertime Ball. He is best known for hits such as ‘Me, Myself and I’, ‘Sober’, and ‘Him and I’, which will no doubt go down well with the crowd. Finally, bringing Palo Santo to the Ball are trio <strong>Years & Years</strong>. Known for putting on visually stunning performances, we can’t wait to see what Olly, Emre and Mikey will do this year.</p><p>They join the previously confirmed <a href=#>Shawn Mendes, Charlie Puth, Rudimental, Jess Glynne, Jax Jones</a>, <a href=#>Camila Cabello, Clean Bandit, Stefflon Don, Jonas Blue, Yungen</a>, <a href=#>Anne-Marie, Craig David, James Arthur, Mabel and Sean Paul</a>.</p><p>Tickets for this year’s Summertime Ball are available <a href=#>now</a>.
