The Too Hot to Handle star is dreaming about warmer days, sharing flashback photos of herself in a swimsuit on the beach. "Take me back," she captioned on her her recent Instagram posts. "So beautiful," commented one of her followers. How does she stay so fit?

She loves vegan sushi, protein shakes, smoothie bowls with granola and fruit, plant-based fast food, vegan Pho, and even vegan pizza from Domino's Pizza.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kayla is all about crystals and meditation. "Today was such an amazing day✨ My friends and I visited the vortexes of Sedona, they are believed to be spiritual locations where the energy is right to facilitate prayer, meditation, and healing. Along the way we picked up some crystals. When we got there I sat as the sun was setting and had the most surreal meditation ever, I also cleansed and charged my new crystals. The vibes were immaculate," she captioned an Instagram post.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kayla also enjoys hiking, which she did in Sedona. "Hiking is one of the best ways to get exercise. No matter what type of trail you find yourself on, hiking is a great whole-body workout—from head to toe and everything in between," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>National Parks Service</span></a><span>. Some of the physical benefits include building stronger muscles and bones, improving your sense of balance, improving your heart health, and decreasing the risk of certain respiratory problems. It also offers many mental health benefits, according to a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Stanford University</span></a><span> study.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kayla spends a lot of time at the beach and loves going swimming. Swimming is a good way to get regular aerobic physical activity, according to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>CDC</span></a><span>. Just two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity, such as swimming, bicycling, or running, can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses. In addition to the many physical benefits, there are multiple studies supporting the mental health benefits of swimming as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kayla also spends a lot of time walking on the beach. Going for a daily walk can be a game changer in terms of exercise, especially at a brisk speed. One study published in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>JAMA Internal Medicine</span></a><span> found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpJmpoa5uvsicn5qqpGK2r3nBmquhoZ6cerTByK1koqtdqLxursSarK2hlqq5cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dan-avidan.html><span>←</span><span>Dan Avidan - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Body Measurement, Career</span></a>
