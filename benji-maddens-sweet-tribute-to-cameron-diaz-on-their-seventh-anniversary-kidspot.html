Source: Instagram</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;Cameron Diaz’s secret life as a retiree</strong></p><h3>“Making time go slower”</h3><p>Madden, who is known for posting sweet messages about his wife, wrote:</p><p>“Today 7 years married. Always dreamed of having a family like this.</p><p>“Happy, peaceful, consistent, loyal and unconditional equally filled with passion and depth. Calling it a Honeymoon doesn’t cover it. Real life.”</p><p>The loved-up singer added; “The only real challenge we have is making time go slower cause life goes by fast in the happy lane.</p><p>“Always and forever knowing we are home @camerondiaz Happy Anniversary. I love you!”</p><p>//www.instagram.com/embed.js</p><h3>Cameron’s response</h3><p>The comments section was quickly filled with congratulations, and Diaz herself commented too.</p><p>“I ✨❤️✨YOU MORE AND MORE EVERYDAY. Happy, peaceful, consistent, loyal and unconditional. Passionate and deep = OUR LOVE. LOVE YOUR FOREVER AND ALWAYS.”</p><p>Madden’s brother Joel added, “Y’all are the Goats”, meaning greatest of all time.</p><p>Australia’s own musician Ben Lee also wrote, “Beautiful.”</p><h3>A long history&nbsp;</h3><p>Diaz and Madden tied the knot in a secret ceremony in 2015. Three years later, Diaz confirmed that she had retired from acting.</p><p>They welcomed their daughter, Raddix, two, in late 2019.</p><p>During a chat on the podcast,&nbsp;Anna Faris is Unqualified, in September 2021, Diaz opened up about meeting Madden for the first time through his twin brother Joel and his wife Nicole Richie.&nbsp;</p><p>“I met mine through my now sister-in-law and brother-in-law, I met them first and then they didn’t set us up but we were in the same room because of them, and then we found each other,” she shared.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was like, ‘How come I didn’t see him before?'”</p><p>When asked if the connection she had with Benji was influenced by any connection she had with Joel, Cameron was quick to point out the differences between the two.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re not the same, they’re so different,” she said. “Even though they’re twins, they’re very, very different obviously.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cameron then went on to elaborate on just how immediately attracted she was to Benji.</p><p>“I saw him walking towards me and I was like, ‘Huh, he’s hot, I haven’t seen him before,'” she revealed.&nbsp;</p><p>“But then when I saw him, like who he was, that’s what made me really be like, ‘Oh you, you’re special, you’re the guy, you’re the hidden gem in my life.'”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tompWjt6p5zJqbnZ2eqHq0w8Seq2asop6vtsDEZquoZZOWuqa%2BzqdknaGRr3qwuoytn56homLApsLEp6uhZZGju6rCxKuqmqqpYriqsNKppq1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-deborah-mccrary-from-the-mccrary-sisters.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Deborah McCrary From The McCrary Sisters?
