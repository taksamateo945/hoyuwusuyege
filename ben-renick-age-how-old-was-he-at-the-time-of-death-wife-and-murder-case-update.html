Wife And Murder Case Update</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Ben Renick</strong>, a world-renowned snake breeder, was discovered dead in June 2017. Today we’ll chat about his age and his wife, Lynlee Renick. In June 2017, the body of snake breeder Ben Renick was discovered. Ben’s death made headlines because his unusual demise piqued the interest of many people at the time.</p><p>Authorities thought one of Renick’s snakes escaped and murdered him when he was discovered dead at one of his sites. However, the case subsequently ended differently when Renick was shot to death. As Secrets of the Snake Farm exposes the horrific murder, the story is once again in the spotlight. A years-long inquiry ultimately revealed that his widowed wife was behind the murder plot.</p><h2>Ben Renick’s Age & Wikipedia: How Old Was The Snake Breeder?</h2><p><strong>At the time of his death, Ben Renick was 29 years old</strong>. The snake breeder was always fascinated with snakes. In 2010, he founded Renick Reptiles Inc. to pursue his ambition. Furthermore, Renick sold his snakes to customers from the United Kingdom to Japan. As a boy, Renick was reared on a farm by his parents in New Florence, Missouri, with his brother, Sam.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ben-Renick-1.jpg alt="Ben Renick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ben, on the other hand, specialized in enormous ball pythons and anacondas. He even sold those fancy pythons for a good profit. Renick was selling the python breeding portion of his firm to NHL star Robin Lehner when he died. Renick made a lot of money as a result of his job. Renick resided in a home that was eventually sold for roughly $800,000. Renick reportedly had a net worth of $2 million.</p><h2>Ben and Lynlee Renick’s Married Life</h2><p>Ben and Lynlee Renick met when they were adolescents and reunited in 2011. They dated after knowing one other for a while and decided to take their relationship to the next level.&nbsp;So, Ben and Lynlee married in 2014. The couple eventually had a kid together. Lynlee also assisted Ben at the snake breeding facility. Their marriage thereafter became strained. They even started a second company called Ascensia Spa Inc. However, it did not do well due to financial difficulties.&nbsp;Lynlee was unfaithful to her spouse with at least two other men around three years into their marriage. Ben is suspicious, according to their messages. The relationship was also in trouble.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ben-Renick-2.jpg alt="Ben Renick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Update on the Ben Renick Murder Case: Where Is Wife Lynlee Renick Now?</h2><p>In June 2017, Ben Renick was shot to death on his reptile farm in New Florence. Although police first suspected one of his pythons was to blame, witnesses came forward with critical evidence regarding his wife, Lynlee Renick.&nbsp;Prosecutors told the jury at Lynlee’s murder trial in 2021 that she murdered her husband for his $1 million life insurance policy to salvage her spa company and exit a failing marriage. Renick joined her ex-boyfriend Michael Humphrey in the murder plot, and he is said to have fired the trigger. Renrick was therefore found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal activity. Lynlee was sentenced to 16 years in prison in January 2022, according to reports. She is currently incarcerated in the Chillicothe Correctional Center for Women in Livingston County, Missouri.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZnqZdp7KvtcKkZJqflWK1sMOMqKOdZaeWwG60xGaYrWWknbJuwMimnGanlmKxpq3ToWSwoZaaeqK6w2akrqqUmr9ur8CsnGatoJmutbGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./allison-mack-speaks-out-days-ahead-of-sentencing-for-role-in-nxivm-cult.html><span>←</span><span>Allison Mack Speaks Out Days Ahead of Sentencing for Role in NXIVM Cult</span></a>
