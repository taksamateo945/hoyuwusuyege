He picked up four birdies to help improve his score, but crushed his progress with two bogies and a double bogey on the back nine.</p><p>He showed improvement in Round 2, carding a one-over-par, but with Thursday's disastrous performance, he was far from the cut line.</p><p>Unlike Woods and Mickelson, Rahm is just out of reach of the projected cut line. Rahm finished Round 2 even at par, just one stroke away from advancing to Round 3.</p><p>Despite collecting five bogies in Round 1, Rahm managed to get to one-under-par due to six birdies. On Friday, he had a bogey and a birdie in the front nine and had two more birdies and a bogey on the back nine. He would have had enough to advance had it not been for a double bogey on the 17th hole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmaCc4OMqZ6aZZOdrq68yKilrKCZpXqkwdNmo6KmlWJ%2FcX6TZquin5Wneri7zp2qZpmemXqxvs6jnJyslZl6rbXSrWSonl2luaLFxKuqZqqVory3scM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dope-and-gucci-eg-crossword-clue-la-times-1169250.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Dope and gucci, e.g. Crossword Clue LA Times</span></a>
