In his absence, Solo Sikoa has taken over the stable and assumed the role of leader, much to the chagrin of Paul Heyman.</p><p>To support his run at the top of the stable, Sikoa has brought in Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa, but tension with The Wise Man has set the stage for an eventual split in the Bloodline and Reigns' return as a babyface.</p><p>Dave Meltzer of <i>Wrestling Observer Radio</i> reported that the former champion could be back on WWE programming by July, setting up a possible appearance at SummerSlam when it comes to Cleveland Browns Stadium on August 3.</p><p>"Heyman and Roman are being turned babyface by the audience," he said (h/t <a href=# rel=noopener>Subhojeet Mukherjee</a> of Ringside News). "They make it clear that he's coming back soon. So, I figure that's probably in July."</p><p>If Meltzer's report is accurate, WWE should hold Reigns off television until SummerSlam. Once Rhodes disposes of AJ Styles at Clash at the Castle, he will need a new challenger, setting the stage for Sikoa to claim his spot as No. 1 contender at the August premium live event.</p><p>With Sikoa carrying the Anoaʻi family crest and talking about his role as the new head of the table, Reigns should make his return after Rhodes disposes of the de facto Tribal Chief.</p><p>As the champion celebrates his hard-fought victory over Sikoa—despite inference from Tonga and Loa—Reigns' music should hit, sending Cleveland into a frenzy. Once in the ring, the real Tribal Chief should set his eyes on Rhodes and the championship he wants back.</p><p>As Sikoa and his new stable enter the ring and stand behind Reigns, he should turn his back on the trio and walk out, clearly projecting his disgust at how The Bloodline has acted since his departure.</p><p>By setting up Reigns as a man returning to WWE alone, the creative team would have the ideal groundwork for a stable war between members of The Bloodline.</p><p>Eventually, Sikoa, Tonga and Loa will kick Heyman to the curb and set their sights on The Head of the Table.</p><p>Reigns, outnumbered for the first time in years, will find support from the newly reformed tag team of Jimmy and Jey Uso. The three-on-three battle would be marquee enough on its own to warrant a WarGames match in November.</p><p>The odds wouldn't remain even for long, though, as The Rock's return would have him side with Sikoa and the heels, setting the stage for another multi-man match and a WrestleMania 41 headline bout between Reigns and his cousin.</p><p>Add in the fact that Reigns could be the one who introduces Jacob Fatu as the new and improved version of Sikoa, and the Bloodline warfare storyline has enough meat on the bone to carry WWE's creative department through 2024 and most of 2025.</p><p>And it all starts with Reigns returning at SummerSlam.</p><p><i>For more wrestling talk, listen to </i><a href=# rel=noopener>Ring Rust Radio</a><i> for all of the hot topics or catch the latest episode in the player above (some language NSFW).</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiEcYWMqamenJmYwaq6xmapqKWRo3qzscigpaxloprBtr7NZquoZaessm6tzKKbZpqcpLyluMinnGacopa6og%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./philadelphia-cody-heron-arrest.html><span>←</span><span>Philadelphias Cody Heron: Arrest and Charges Explained</span></a>
