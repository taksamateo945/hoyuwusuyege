It follows earlier clashes where Australian military aircraft were threatened by Chinese fighter jets using potentially dangerous flares and chaff, and another targeted by high-power military-grade Chinese lasers."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

resources that the US military can call on.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s becoming increasingly difficult – Australia is to a degree isolated,’ Prof Rothwell of Australian National University told the ABC.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is clear there is a pattern associated with Australia’s activities now [that is] very much aligned with the way in which the United States conducts similar activities.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It needs to be accepted that Australia is often sailing through those waters on their own without a lot of back-up, in the way that the US Navy would often have.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The fears were echoed by former defence personnel minister Darren Chester.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘What concerns me is there’s more likely to be some incident at a future point resulting from a level of misadventure or miscalculation or mistake being made than an actual act of aggression,’ the Nationals MP said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We need to be very careful and need to make sure we are working closely with our allies. I think it is really important that we try and de-escalate these situations wherever possible.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘At the same time, we have every right to be there. The Australian navy is incredibly professional, incredibly well-trained and incredibly capable and they are just doing their job.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-863a9e22bc1e2b3d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/13/23/60205349-11011567-image-a-2_1657752600696.jpg height=416 width=634 alt="In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane's jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane’s jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane’s jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And another Australian Poseidon surveillance aircraft was targeted by high-powered military lasers from a Chinese ship off the north coast of Australia in February.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the federal election campaign, the ADF was also tracking a Chinese naval ship off the west coast of Australia, apparently monitoring military signal traffic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On Sunday, four&nbsp;USAF B-2A stealth bombers landed in Queensland&nbsp;in a high-profile show of strength and support for Australia.</p><img decoding=async id=i-61a10a3ceda8ca05 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/13/23/60242193-11011567-image-m-10_1657753154345.jpg height=483 width=634 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>On Sunday, four USAF B-2A stealth bombers landed in Queensland in a high-profile show of strength and support for Australia</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The ‘flying wing’-style aircraft flew 14,000km from their US base in Missouri&nbsp;on a ‘training and strategic deterrence mission&nbsp;in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Squadron commander Lieutenant Colonel Kousgaard added: ‘This deployment of the B-2 to Australia demonstrates and enhances the readiness and lethality of our long-range penetrating strike force.’&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkarAtb7ApaCaZZOdtq%2BtjK2cp6uZpLu0edKpmKujXaiys7XOrqpmoZ6YtqWxza1kn52Rp3qistOeqWaonJZ6rrXLoquaqqlisKmty6Wcp5%2BVYq6lsoynmK%2BxXayus7%2FHoqdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1392665-former-mlb-pitcher-pascual-perez-killed-in-home-invasion.html><span>←</span><span>Former MLB Pitcher Pascual Perez Killed in Home Invasion | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumo</span></a>
