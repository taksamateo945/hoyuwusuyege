As Eric’s website states, the 34-year-old now works as a <b>director, editor, audio engineer, and producer for his production company LP Studios in L.A. Oh</b>, and based on this Instagram photo, he’s also quite the beer model as well.</p><p>in the same way, Why did Curtis become head elf? David Krumholtz wasn’t available since his Numbers schedule conflicted with the filming. Because of this, <b>the script was written with</b> the returning character Curtis having taken over as the Head Elf.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_Bernard_not_in_The_Santa_Clause_3></span>Why is Bernard not in The Santa Clause 3?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David Krumholtz Didn’t Appear in ‘Santa Clause 3’ <b>Because His Character Was “Devalued a Little Bit” in the Script</b>. The actor, who played fan-favorite head elf Bernard, clarifies that it wasn’t scheduling that kept him from appearing in the third installment of the Tim Allen-led Christmas franchise.</p><p>Why is Bernard the only tall elf? While they have the appearance of small children, Bernard looks like he’s in his teenage years and <b>is much taller</b>. This could be because he’s not a full Elf and only stayed on the North Pole; he’s aging at a slower rate but still much older than the average child.</p><p>Who is Lucy to Scott Calvin? Lucy Miller is <b>Neil and Laura’s daughter</b>, Scott Calvin and Carol Newman-Calvin’s honorary niece, and Charlie Calvin’s half sister in The Santa Clause 2 and The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause.</p><p>What happened Paige Tamada?

While most of the elves were played by children, Bernard’s actor, David Krumholtz, was 16 years old during filming, making him noticeably taller and older.</p><p>Why is Bernard bigger than the other elves? While they have the appearance of small children, Bernard looks like he’s in his teenage years and <b>is much taller</b>. This could be because he’s not a full Elf and only stayed on the North Pole; he’s aging at a slower rate but still much older than the average child.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_oldest_elf_in_The_Santa_Clause></span>Who is the oldest elf in The Santa Clause?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Summary: <b>Elwyn</b>, Santa’s oldest elf, and Blitzen, a retired reindeer, help Santa out for one last Christmas.</p><p>Why is Bernard the elf so tall?</p><p>While most of the elves were played by children, Bernard’s actor, David Krumholtz, was 16 years old during filming, making <b>him noticeably taller and older</b>. In addition, Bernard is not as cheerful as the other elves, instead acting gruff and strict toward Scott as he explains the “Santa Clause” to him.</p><p>Is Bernard the Elf Nick Miller? Madelyn Kahler on Twitter: “Just found out nick Miller and Bernard the <b>elf are played by the same guy</b>” / Twitter.</p><p>Is Bernard Santa’s son?

Let’s begin with something we all know is true: <b>Santa Claus is real</b>. New York Sun’s newspaper reported it in 1897. There are historical records about St. Nick going all the way back to the 3rd Century.</p><p>Who does Santa Claus marry?</p><p><b>Claus (also known as Mrs.</b> <b>Santa Claus)</b> is the legendary wife of Santa Claus, the Christmas gift-bringer in Western Christmas tradition.

A weird police report. Speaking of those elves with jetpacks, they’re known as E.L.F.S. (<b>Effective Liberating Flight Squad</b>), and they’re called into service when Santa is arrested after attempting to do his Santa thing at Laura and Neil’s house.</p><p>Is Santa an elf?</p><p>Santa was a human, Saint Nicholas, who lived in what is now Turkey, during the Byzantine Empire. After he died, he <b>was reincarnated as an Elf in Northern Europe</b>. So now he’s an Elf.</p><h2></h2><p>Don’t forget to share this post !</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKmt02afmqigmrumsIytpmabpafBqr%2BMn6mopV2orq%2FAwGaapZmlqLJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./todd-chrisley-and-wife-julie-indicted-for-tax-evasion-chrisley-knows-best-stars-claim-innocence-311177.html><span>←</span><span>Todd Chrisley And Wife Julie Indicted for Tax Evasion Chrisley Knows Best Stars Claim Innocence</span></a>
