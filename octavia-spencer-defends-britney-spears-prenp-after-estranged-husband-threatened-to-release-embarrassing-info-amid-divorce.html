Spencer, however, issued a stern but practical word of advice in the comments on Spears’ Instagram post: “Make him <a href=#>sign a prenup</a>.” The “Ma” star was met with backlash, which prompted her to issue an apology to the couple.</p><p>“Y’all, a few days ago Sam and Britney announced their engagement and me being me I made a joke. My intention was to make them laugh not cause pain,” said Spencer in her own Instagram post.</p><p>She added, “I’ve reached out to this lovely couple privately to apologize and now want to restore just a smidge of happiness they were robbed of.” Asghari responded, writing that there were no hard feelings. The couple was married with an iron-clad prenup in place in June 2022.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>Octavia Spencer Apologizes After Giving ‘Prenup’ Advice to Britney Spears After Singer Announces Her Engagement</a></p><p>Now that a divorce is in the works, several reports have&nbsp;claimed that Asghari accused the pop star of infidelity, alleging that she was caught on camera in a “compromising” position with a male staff member.</p><p>Additionally, <a href=#>Page Six</a> reported that the Iranian-American model is “attempting to negotiate concessions beyond his prenup and threatening to go public with extraordinarily embarrassing information about Britney unless he gets paid.” In his filing, the actor is reportedly seeking spousal support and requesting that the mother of two pay his legal fees.</p><p>Spencer seemingly showed her support for Spears when she commented, “Extortion is illegal,” on a post about the allegations against the singer’s soon-to-be ex-husband.
