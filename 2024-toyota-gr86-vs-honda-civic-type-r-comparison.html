The GR86 is best enjoyed with its standard six-speed manual gearbox, offering a fun driving experience with sharp steering and nimble handling. Despite its small rear seats, they can be used for extra cargo space when needed. The GR86 provides all these features at a reasonable price. On the other hand, the 2023 Honda Civic Type R has a more subdued appearance compared to its predecessor but still delivers an exciting driving experience. It now comes with an upgraded six-speed manual transmission and improved brake cooling for track performance. With its manufacturing split between Japan and Ohio, the new CTR promises a thrilling driving experience on and off the track.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Toyota GR86</strong></td><td><strong>Honda Civic Type-R</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>167.9 in x 69.9 in x 51.6 in</td><td>180.9 in x 74.4 in x 55.4 in</td></tr><tr><td>Engine</td><td>2.4L naturally aspirated flat-4</td><td>2.0L turbocharged inline-4</td></tr><tr><td>Horsepower</td><td>228 hp</td><td>315 hp&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Torque</td><td>184 lb-ft</td><td>301 lb-ft</td></tr><tr><td>0-60 MPH</td><td>5.4 sec</td><td>4.9 sec</td></tr><tr><td>0-100 MPH</td><td>13.8 sec</td><td>12.1 sec</td></tr><tr><td>Top-Speed</td><td>140 mph</td><td>169 mph</td></tr></tbody></table>Specs</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Toyota_GR86>Toyota GR86</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-toyota-gr-86-trueno-103-648cac921d85c.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Engine_Power_Performance>Engine, Power & Performance</span></h3><p>The GR86 is equipped with a Subaru-provided naturally aspirated horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine. In the previous generation, it offered decent acceleration with a 0-60 mph time of 6.2 seconds. However, the latest GR86 model has shown significant improvement, achieving a 0-60 mph time of 5.4 seconds and covering a quarter-mile in 14.0 seconds. This enhancement can be attributed to a more powerful 2.4-liter engine that generates 228 horsepower. The GR86 comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission, while a six-speed automatic is available as an option. It’s worth noting that the six-speed automatic lags behind the manual transmission by 0.7 seconds in the 0-60 mph acceleration<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">.</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Price_Features>Price & Features</span></h3><p>The additional cost for the Toyota GR86 Premium is a worthwhile investment. Opting for the Premium version provides you with a range of desirable features. These include heated seats, sleek 18-inch wheels with high-performance tires, adaptive LED headlights, and an enhanced eight-speaker audio system. Choosing the six-speed manual transmission is a clear decision for this model. The GR86’s starting price for the Base trim is estimated to be around $30,000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Honda_Civic_Type-R>Honda Civic Type-R</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2023-honda-civic-type-r-4129-1668454309.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Engine_Power_Performance-2>Engine, Power & Performance</span></h3><p>The latest iteration of the Civic Type R retains the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine from its predecessor, but notable enhancements have been made to elevate its performance. A redesigned turbocharger, along with a more efficient exhaust system, has resulted in an increased power output of 315 horsepower at 6500 rpm and 310 pound-feet of torque ranging from 2600 to 4000 rpm. During rigorous testing on a track, the CTR showcased its exceptional performance capabilities. It accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.9 seconds and completed the quarter-mile in an impressive 13.5 seconds, reaching a speed of 106 mph.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Price_Features-2>Price & Features</span></h3><p>The Honda Civic Type R offers a highly competitive starting price that aligns with its impressive performance. With minimal additional options available beyond its initial MSRP, the CTR not only outshines the Volkswagen Golf R in affordability but also comes close to matching the price of the entry-level Toyota Supra. While personal preference will determine the appeal of two seats versus four, the most powerful Civic Type R stands as an accessible sports car with the convenience of five doors. The Honda Civic Type R starts at $44,890. Honda’s latest infotainment system is seamlessly integrated into the Civic Type R, featuring a user-friendly 9.0-inch touchscreen located on the dashboard. It comes equipped with sought-after features like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, ensuring convenient connectivity. Additionally, the inclusion of a subscription-based Wi-Fi hotspot and wireless smartphone charging further enhances the overall technology package.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqYaK8tbvRoqWgZpOkunB%2Bj2trZqyfrry1rYygqXFuXavAbrTOp5uaZZOew6qvjK2wqZ1dp3qku8ypmKuho6S7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./florence-henderson.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Florence Henderson dating?
