The high school BFFs donned tea-length maroon and white skirts and collar tops with “B” lettering for Bayside High — and white <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> and socks to boot!</p><p>The walk down memory lane (friends forever!), as Berkley suggested, is a far cry from her Showgirls stint. Two years after saying goodbye to Bayside, the actress traded in her scrunchies and mom jeans for, well, nothing. Her portrayal as a Vegas stripper earned Berkley brutal backlash from critics, but she’s clearly moved on from it all. In fact, she laughed about the camp classic during the <a href=# rel=noopener>epic Saved by the Bell reunion</a> on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon on Feb. 4.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/MSDSHGI_EC001_H_Elizabeth-Berkley-Showgirls-467.jpg><p>After Berkley recreated her famous “I’m so excited!” quote, <strong>Mark-Paul Gosselaar</strong> (as Zack Morris) referred to Showgirls while chatting with Fallon. “Jimmy going on a date with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a>? It’s like Jessie becoming a stripper!” he said. (Last month, Fallon was shocked to learn that he once unknowingly went on a date with Kidman.)</p><p>Berkley’s remained great friends with her Saved by the Bell costars, and has since posted several photos from the must-see reunion. “No matter how much time goes by, this connection is lasting…you can’t #fake magic,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned an Instagram pic</a> of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Mario Lopez</strong></a>, who played her TV boyfriend A.C. Slater.</p><p>“Life can have ups and downs, but I love that this childhood memory made you guys smile — grateful for everyone’s support and joy,” she added. “It’s the best feeling to connect on something meant for nothing but FUN.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJyloaqWr6bAx2aZnqqbobK6ec%2Boop6rXZvCr3nOn2SsoJ%2BstKq%2By6xkqaejqcBuv8CvnJ1lkq56tbTEZpmepJxivaqvjGtnam1hZn8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./avi-gupta-wikipedia-jeopardy-family-age.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Avi Gupta?
